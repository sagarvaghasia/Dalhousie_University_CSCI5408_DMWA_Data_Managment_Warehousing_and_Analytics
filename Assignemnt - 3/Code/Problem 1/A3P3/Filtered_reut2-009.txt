The U.S. dollar has declined in value against the Yen andEuropean currencies, but has changed very little against thecurrencies of some developing countries such as South Korea andTaiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar.    As a result, efforts to reduce the value of the dollar overthe past year and a half have done little to improve the tradedeficits with those countries.

Jim Billington, Farm Credit Administration (FCA) boardmember told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommitteehearing "I feel your subcommittee should plan on providing atleast 800 mln next year to assist the Farm Credit System."    However, FCA board member Marvin Duncan differed, saying"it is premature to talk about the cost of a solution until weknow what kind of solution."    Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, said it might bepossible to structure a rescue of the system with governmentguarantees or a line of credit which requires little or noupfront government money.    However, Billington said Congress must provide helpimmediately because "this system needs some assurance that itwill get some help."    The FCA estimates the system could lose up to 1.4 billiondlrs in 1987, exhausting the remainder of its working capital,Naylor said.    The farm credit system is expected to present its ownproposals for government aid to a Senate Agriculturesubcommittee hearing on Thursday.    Naylor said the Treasury Department is continuing to refineReagan administration ideas on how a rescue should bestructured.    Congressional sources said they hope to begin drafting arescue bill for the farm credit system as early as next week.

He said in a statement a crash program was needed in thesemiconductor industry to prevent the United States frombecoming "one of the world's industrial lightweights."    Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic PolicyCouncil prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide whatsanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged violations of a U.S. Japanese semiconductors agreement.    The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to endselling semiconductors at below cost and to open its homemarket to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to foregoantidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors.    But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stoppeddumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third countrydumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.    Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action,ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way toforce prices up and end the dumping.    Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense ScienceBoard task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop newelectronic products and manufacturing processes and make theU.S. industory more competitive.    But he added the industry could not wait for legislation topass and that action was required now to help the depressedelectronic industry.    Bywater said, "I urge the Reagan Administration to take fulland severe action immediately against Japan by invoking theretaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)."

Although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceivethat the six major industrial nations have differing levels ofcommitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies.    Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway overthe currency market than central bank intervention and theseargue for a further dollar decline, dealers said.    "The market can be bigger than the central banks. Andeconomic fundamentals will always come to the fore," said adealer at one major U.S. bank.    As the dollar dropped to post World War II lows against theyen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan,Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in themarkets on behalf of the U.S. currency.    Reports of the authorities' actions helped the dollarrecover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon fromthe post war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it stillfailed to regain Monday's U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen.    Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollarsyesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve.    Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that theFed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yentoday. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchaseda small amount of dollars for yen.    The Fed's last confirmed intervention was on January 28when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank ofJapan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to havesignalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks.    The authorities' actions appeared to back up the February22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperateto foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels.    But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed bythe authorities' intervention which they said can only softenextreme moves in the market.    For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed'spurchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather thanfor the U.S. central bank's own account, suggesting a rather  watered down American commitment to the currency accord.    The Bank of England's action also was thought to becompleted on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcingthe market's view that Japan is the most resolute of the sixnations in its support of the currency pact.    "No one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the othertwo central banks seem to be making more token gestures thananything else," said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp.    "I'm not convinced the intervention was concerted," saidEarl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. "It's a yen problem more than anything else."    Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionistsentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the Americanauthorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen.    "The dollar's break below the key 150 yen level ties theTreasury's hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene onits own account because of the strength of protectionism here,"said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp.    Such comments reflect the view that the currency marketsare becoming increasingly politicized. Despite officialdenials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance alower dollar to help trim the nation's trade deficit.    The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise tradedeficit in 1986 was with Japan.    Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker's comment onSunday that the February currency pact had not establisheddollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell theU.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat.    "The dollar still has more room on the downside against theyen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. Thecurrency market is becoming very political," said Natsuo Okadaof Sumitomo Bank Ltd.    Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yenthis week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the endof April or early May.

Automakers sold about 204,000 cars in the March 11 20selling period, 10,000 fewer than last year. Analysts said thedecline may auger poorly for the rest of the spring season.    Buyers shied away from the showrooms of American MotorsCorp AMO>, the target of a 1.5 billion dlr takeover bid fromChrysler Corp C>. Analysts said consumers were anxious aboutthe whether Chrysler will retain some American Motors models,causing a 62 pct drop in American Motors sales in mid March.    Chrysler's mid March sales fell 3.6 pct.    "During the spring selling season, you usually look forsome kind of seasonal uplift in sales. It doesn't look likeit's happening," said Joseph Philippi, analyst with E.F. Huttonand Co.    "There may be less bloom to the spring selling season thisyear than last," one auto company official conceded.    General Motors Corp GM>, still working to regain consumerinterest in its cars, led the drop with a 14.8 pct decline.    Ford Motor Co's F> sales increased 15.2 pct for theperiod. But analysts said the rise compares to a 1986 periodfor Ford, leaving it down 10 pct in two years.    "The total industry (mid March sales) was slightly lessthan expected," the company official said.    American Motors' decline caught analysts eye. "AmericanMotors took it on the chin big," said Philippi.    Given the prospective takeover by Chrysler, "people mightbe a little leary about going to (American Motors) dealers," hesaid.    American Motors sold 790 domestic cars in the period,meaning each of American Motors 1,050 dealers "is selling a carabout every other day," Philippi said.

Under the offer, Resorts said holders of its class A shareswould receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares ofcommon stock in the new company.    Resorts said the offer from KSZ calls for a merger ofResorts with RI Acquisition Co Inc, a newly formed Delawarecorporation.    Resorts said that prior to the merger, RI Acquisition wouldbe capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220mln dlrs of equity.    It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form ofspecial preferred stock.    The KSZ offer, Resorts said, indicates that KSZ has acommitment from M.

Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existingclass A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct ofthe outstanding common of the new company formed to acquireResorts.    Resorts said the new company, upon completion of themerger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that thespecial preferred stock would immediately be converted intoexchangeable participating preferred of the new company.    This preferred, Resorts said, would pay a dividend based onthe net cash flows from the new company's Paradise Islandoperations.    A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in atwo page letter and that Resorts could not comment on itbecause it did not contain enough information. Resorts hasasked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said.

Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St. Germain aproposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countriesthat do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their governmentdebt markets might invite retaliation against U.S. firmsabroad.    He added, "even Japan, against whom this proposal seems tobe particularly directed," has started opening its markets.    In his letter, made available at the Treasury, Volcker alsosaid a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countriesby setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed tocommercial banks, was a problem.    "I believe that the prospect of debt relief would underminethe difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries toachieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of thepolicies that are followed on servicing external debt," Volckersaid.    It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant toextend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said.    Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury SecretaryJames Baker "about the inappropriateness of using publicresources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which weboth see as an inherent aspect of the proposed internationaldebt facility."    He also said a proposal for establishing formal proceduresfor international negotiations on currency exchange rates "isunrealistic and could well have damaging effects."    "For example, the bill's directive to intitiate negotiationsin order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar  a matter upon which there can be considerable differenceamong analysts   runs the risk of building up potentiallydestabilizing market expectations," Volcker said.    He recommended "we should not lock ourselves into formalizedprocedures for international negotiations" on exchange rates butinstead use other, more flexible means like the recent mmetingin Paris between U.S. treasury and central bank representativesand those of major trade allies.

USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures willlikely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres,down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres.    Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. cornproduction will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987corn production could drop by over one billion bushels toaround seven billion bushels.    Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grainsprogram, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservationprogram, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrainanalysts said.    "There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease incorn acreage," one said. "It's difficult for any farmer to notgo along with the program this year."    Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year butat a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.    Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, theysaid, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.    If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then thedrop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 whenfarmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment In Kind program.    Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. Asevere drought that summer in major producing states causedyields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2billion bushels.    Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analystssaid the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billionbushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.    "This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significantreduction in production," an analyst said.    A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would notincrease significantly, a specialist said.    High producing corn belt states are expected to show thegreatest acreage reductions, based upon historicalparticipation in government programs, analysts said.    In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the mostin marginal producing areas of the southeast and the westerncorn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.    "Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,"he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts inhigher producing delta areas.    Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.    U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, hassteadily declined in the 1980's.    U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been inthe low to mid 80 mln acre range for the past 10 years. Thehighest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA haskept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mlnacres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.    Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yieldsaveraging 119.3 bushels per acre.    "We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billionbushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so," an analyst said.    Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres aslong as government program provisions remain the same, analystssaid.    Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required toset aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligiblefor payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15pct of their acreage.    "To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have toprovide more incentives," an analyst said.

Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies torecoup export markets lost to competing nations' unfair tradingpractices.

The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R Iowa),would clarify the definition of "industry" in determining whetheror not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers.    Grassley's bill stems from a 1985 decision by theInternational Trade Commission that imports from Canada of liveswine   but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork   were harmingU.S. producers.    The bill's proponents have argued Canada has simplyreplaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork.

Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the Housesubcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated theeasing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern aboutthe impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year.    "With imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to onemln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbeancountries and the Philippines," Huckaby said.    By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, thequota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons.    Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the thirdquarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the Septemberto December period "we could get away without having toincrease the quota."    He noted that some in the sugar industry believe anincrease in the quota is justified.    Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugarrefiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials torequest a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refinerssaid the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictivethere could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S laterthis year, a refiner spokesman said.    However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that itwould consider the request.    Following the refiners' request, representatives of theFlorida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express oppositionto any quota expansion, industry sources said.    The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from asugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect ofthe current sugar program, indicates at least some growerofficials are concerned enough to support an easing of theimport quota, industry officials said.    Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by theReagan administration's interagency sugar policy group.    Asked about possible quota changes, A USDA official said"As far as I know, changing the quota volume or the quota yearis not under active consideration."

In the latest flashpoint in Canadian U.S. trade relations,the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimouslyMonday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 millionU.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry.    "We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure thatCanadian interests are well protected," Clark told the House ofCommons in the daily question period.    But he said the opposition parties should be careful "notto raise false alarms too early."    The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department'strade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potashproducers from New Mexico, claiming unfair governmentsubsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada's shipments.    Canada, the world's largest potash producer, exported 9.8mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a thirdgoing to the U.S.    Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer,comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan.    In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded theruling as just another "trade harrassment" from the U.S. andcriticized Clark's assurances the country's interests would beprotected.    "We received exactly the same kind of assurances in thesoftwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,"Axworthy said.    Canada's Progressive Conservative government agreed toimpose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlierthis year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute withthe U.S.    Axworthy urged the government to present Canada's case toworld trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another exampleof why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateralirritants in the free trade negotiations under way with theU.S.    "What we are seeking to do is put in place a bettersystem," Clark said.    Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressedconfidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problemstems from low international commodity prices and notgovernment subsidies.    "The reality of the problem and the injury is causedworldwide," he said. "It's caused by a downturn in thecommodity price for fertilizer, whether it's potash fertilizer,nitrogen fertilizer or whatever."

Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers andbuyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that thelargest are considering offering shares to the public, analystssay.    Retail car sales "are at a point of transition. There's notmuch that's off the table in terms of creative thinking" aboutways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the Universityof Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.    The retail car market is "much more freeform now" than itwas in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroitanalyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.    Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.Dealerships sold one kind of car a "Chevy" or a Ford or aStudebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the NationalAutomobile Dealers Association.    That year a tiny car from overseas Germany's VolkswagenBeatle began to gain popularity. The "Bug" caused "arebellion" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom fromrestrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,says Jauppi.    One of the most visible changes in retail car sales hasbeen in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales a 15 foldincrease from 1956 and employed 34 workers.    "I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mlndlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,"says Cole.    "There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than thatmake cars," he says.    With the increase in size, large dealers have been buyingup other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trendwill let up.    Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.Power, a California based market research firm, says that, by1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800principal owners today.    Many dealers are experimenting with owning severalfranchises, some of which might compete against each other. "Itused to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now aChevrolet dealer might handle several lines," Jauppi says.    As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking aboutthe possibility that some of them might become publicly ownedor open international operations.    Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,"are obviously thinking of very seriously," says Cole.    Although some say the franchise system might get in the wayof a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles totrading in car dealer shares.    "Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thingthe manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells thosecars. It could happen any time," Jauppi says.    "If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at thescale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard toresist taking them public," said another analyst.

Speaking after talks with the committee here, Gros alsosaid he did not expect to make interest payment to the banks atthis moment.    He added that "no one should expect any dramaticdevelopments before March 31."    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68billion dlrs debt to commercial banks and froze short termtrade and money market lines.    Bankers said they would relay the Brazilian request for anextension but declined to say whether they were specificallyendorsing it.    Gros said the decision, which he called a "standstill"arrangement, will be communicated to Brazil's 700 bankcreditors by telex tomorrow. Banks had been pressing Brazil tomake at least a token interest payment, but Gros said thegovernment was unable to comply for the moment.    He stressed however that Brazil was willing to pay as soonas it could, but added that a payment of interest was notconnected with the extension of the credit lines.    "That would not be wise," he said.    He said that the extension of the short term lines wouldnot be carried out through "an official instrument" as there wasnot time to complete the legal requirements.    Gros said Brazil was likely to meet again with the 14 bankadvisory committee once Brazil had information to present on aneconomic plan.

Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflectedeconomic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflectfundamentals.    Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated tobring about currency stability in line with the Parisagreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperateto that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene ifnecessary, adding he did not think a dollar free fall waslikely.    But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currencylevels would be considered in line with underlying economicfundamentals.    In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to holdcurrencies around their then current levels.    Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behindthe fall of the dollar to a record low against the yenyesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as itnervously reacted to statements abroad and to developmentssurrounding trade tensions.    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekendthat the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for thedollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter calledU.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.    The market reacted nervously because the dollar has beenmoving narrowly against the yen since mid January, Sumita said.He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate toremain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharprise of the yen.    The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange ratesin line with the Paris accord, he added.

They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings ofbetween 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mlnin 1985.    The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to paya total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents ashare in 1985.    James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the incometo retail sales.    Analysts said the group's 7 Eleven retail stores and itsfranchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxurygoods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow.    Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put JardineMatheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said heestimates pre tax earnings from retail operations at about 465mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985.    But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd HKLD.HKG> will fall toabout 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985.    The reduced contribution reflects the spin off from HongKong Land of Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September.    Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm asa result of the spin off. Analysts said Jardine will bookrevenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of theyear as part of its retail business, which will increase itsoverall retail income figures.    Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharplyincreased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pctshare of Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>.    Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.    Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest paymentsof about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mlndlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at aboutthe 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.    But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mlndlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.    Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisationsthat will in effect turn it into a holding company for itsdiverse interests.    It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in bothHong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created JardineStrategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest.    A company statement issued last month said the firm willuse the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with anadditional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.    Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stakein the high yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it islikely to develop its own business, analysts said.    "The future of the stock will depend on the firm's abilityto creatively structure some new acquisitions," said Hargreavesof Hoare Govett.    He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a keysector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to itsexisting business.

General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profitforecast, saying targets were under study.    Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group'soutstanding loans at end 1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs,up from 530 mln at end 1985. Deposits and interbank borrowingsrose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters.    Liu said most of the group's profit came from the parentcompany rather than its two wholly owned subsidiaries XiamenInternational Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and LusoInternational Bank Ltd> in Macao.    The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985but did not officially open until March 1986.    Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreignpartner, Hong Kong listed Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cutlast year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreignbanks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the threeChinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.    Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin wereunfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported aloss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of268,000 dlrs in 1985.    The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank ofChina, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15,Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) andXiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10).    One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced thesame problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete onunequal terms with state owned banks.    The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almostsaturated, he added.    Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefittedfrom contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But theforeign banker, who asked not to be named, said it facedinternal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank.    Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the InternationalAgricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and thestate owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eightforeign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of HongKong or overseas Chinese banks.

Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential JapanFederation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), toldreporters: "The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar).The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economyis not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan)."    "The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S.Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as theAmerican situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise," hesaid.    To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen,Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means,including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said.    He rejected recent calls from some government quarters forwage increases this year as a means of raising privateconsumption and thus boosting domestic demand.    "We have to keep wages as low as possible," he said.    He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressingthe outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in additionto hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic marketmanufacturers through cheap imports.    Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsukisaid.    Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and adownturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect serviceindustries, he said.    It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fullyemploy those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, hesaid.    Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall inthe business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possiblerecession in the Japanese economy, he said.    Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyondlevels experienced in 1986.    The government's Economic Planning Agency said last weekthe economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performancesince 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oilprice crisis.    In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost theeconomy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of landand reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along withsteps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.

He told a conference organised by the Development Bank ofSingapore Ltd that Singapore wants to develop the fixed ratesecurities market. He said a state securities market, along thesame lines as the U.S. Government securities market, will bedeveloped to provide a benchmark for corporate bonds.    Teo said the fixed rate securities market will pave the wayfor companies to raise fixed rate funds.    Referring to a proposed change in the broking commissionstructure, Teo said the exchange is likely to introduce asliding scale structure instead of a negotiated commissionstructure. He said the negotiated structure works against smallinvestors, who play an important role in the market.    The market capitalisation of the Stock Exchange ofSingapore increased to 42 billion U.S. Dlrs in January 1987from 32 billion U.S. Dlrs in early 1986, he said.    Teo said the government has picked 15 companies toparticipate in a privatisation program which strives to createopportunities for investors through the sale of 380 mln dlrsworth of shares a year. It will try to increase alternativeinvestment available to investors, he said.    He cautioned against problems in a more competitivesecurities market, adding that the possibility of insidertrading is increased when securities dealing, corporate financeand investment advisory functions are conducted under one roof.But he said the future direction of Singapore's securitiesindustry will be dictated by international trends.

But Belgian Research Minister Guy Verhofstadt toldreporters the two had been given just over a week to end theiropposition or risk plunging EC research into a crisis.    The so called "Framework Program" proposed by the EC'sExecutive Commission was designed to boost research in areassuch as computers, biotechnology and telecommunications andcombat U.S. And Japanese domination in these fields.    The five year program was due to start at the beginning ofthis year, but was delayed by calls from Britain, France andWest Germany for cuts in the proposed budget of 7.7 billionEuropean Currency Units (Ecus), diplomats said.    The EC Commission had already cut the budget from 10.5billion Ecus, but under EC law the program needs the approvalof all member states before it can be launched.    France has withdrawn its objections and backed a newcompromise budget proposed by Verhofstadt to trim spending.    But Britain is continuing its demands for further, sharpcuts in the budget.    West Germany, which yesterday appeared to be ready toaccept the compromise, was also holding back.    Verhofstadt, who chaired the lengthy meeting, said he hadgiven the two states until April 3 to withdraw theiropposition.    But if one or both failed to do so, the EC would be leftwithout a research program, leaving no money for schemes suchas the EC's Esprit information technology drive.    "If that happened ... There would be a grave crisis inEurope's scientific and research policy," Verhofstadt said,adding it could mean research teams being disbanded.    Diplomats said West Germany was close to agreeing to thecompromise, which would limit new spending to 5.4 billion Ecusby allowing for cash already set aside for future projects.    The plan would also set aside at least 16 pct of the 5.4billion Ecus for spending after the end of the five yearprogram, they said. But Britain still maintained theallocations were much too high.    Britain's Research Minister Geoffrey Pattie faced a toughfight to convince his government colleagues they should acceptan increase in spending beyond the 4.2 billion Ecu level so fardemanded by Britain, one diplomat added.

When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, itsaid only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs.    Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on severalclauses of the contract and needs government authorisations.    It said the deal would involve 13 starch factoriesemploying about 5,000 people in eight European Communitycountries plus facilities and commercial operations in other ECstates.    The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by products a year, orabout one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes ofcereals.    Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extendits presence in the European agro industrial industry bothgeographically and in terms of products.    It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugarand of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader.    It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximumquotas, of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share, and saidit foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch inthe future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel.

They said the decision was taken after the Sugar ImportersAssociation asked that the sugar trade be further liberalised.    "The Food Department will cease trading in sugar and will nolonger hold a buffer stock," a senior official said.    He said the government has finalised an agreement withE.D.F.Man (Sugar) Ltd under which E.D.F.Man will hold a bufferstock on the government's behalf of 20,000 tonnes, against the45,000 tonne buffer stock usually held by the Department.    Officials said the size of the buffer stock has beenreduced because the private sector will hold its own stocks.    The agreement with E.D.F. Man includes details such astrigger pricing mechanisms, they said.    Four months ago the Department allowed the private sectorto import sugar without government clearance. The Departmentand the private sector each imported around 115,000 tonnes ofsugar last year, when national consumption was 280,000 tonnes.    An Importers Association official said that "even if theDepartment no longer imports sugar, we would not necessarilybuy more."    This is because the Association would still have to competewith the Cooperatives Wholesale Establishment (CWE), he said.    The CWE is a semi government body and the official saidarrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holdersof food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it, startingApril 1.    Ministry officials said the CWE can either import sugar orbuy it from a local bonded warehousing scheme run by E.D.F. Forthe past two years.

The 14th congress of the Inter Arab Cambiste Associationalso comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulfcurrency system is more real that at any time this decade.    Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said theseissues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected tobe major talking points.    About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks  including some in London and other major non Arab financialcentres   are expected to attend the conference which beginson on Saturday.    Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that agrowing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market,by far the largest in the region, is being carried out inLondon.    The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks,foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks inBahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain basedbanks are boosting their treasury operations in London.    As recession hit the Middle East and the need for tradefinance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrainran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K.Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.    The two major Bahrain based international banks, ArabBanking Corp> and Gulf International Bank BSC> have increasedtheir presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgradingrepresentative offices to branch status to allow dealing.    One economist said: "It is cheaper to run a riyal book inLondon than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain...There is now the nucleus of a two way market in London."    Jeddah based Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposittaker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia,National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November1986.    The major market maker has traditionally been London basedconsortium bank Saudi International Bank> but the kingdomjoint venture Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded itsLondon operation to deposit taker status in mid February.    One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: "Inevitably thevolume of business in London has gained pace with the two newlicences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that mostof the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia."    Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudiriyal market is difficult to quantify.    Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currencydeposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, droppedto the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end September 1986from 13.4 billion at end 1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.    The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyaltrading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become veryquiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks nowstaff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expectArab National Bank> to step up London operations.    Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal marketmoving completely out of the region, partly because of localdemand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi ArabianMonetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderateinternationalisation of the riyal and protect it from unduespeculation.    There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar marketshifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrainand London is still limited.    But for the first time since the formation of the sixnation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signsthat a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.    Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a finalcurrency union would take for the six states   Saudi Arabia,Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.    But plans to link the six currencies in a European MonetarySystem style with a common peg have been discussed at highlevel and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expectedto be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year.    One dealer said: "A lot of exposure is being given todiscussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in theend a political decision has to be taken to give the go ahead."    One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.    The idea of linking the six currencies has been debatedsince the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currentlylinked to a basket of currencies while the other fivecurrencies are either officially or in practice linked to theU.S. Dollar.    Some traders said a currency union could mean speculationagainst the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies,but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of7 1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.    Another topic for debate is expected to be the continuedslide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and theundermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks.

Malaysia's debt service ratio will also be maintained at "alevel no higher than 20 pct," he said. "This is well within thecapacity of the nation to service."    Azraai said the 1986 foreign borrowing level and projectedestimates of 1987 compared favourably with the peak of around5.5 billion ringgit in 1982.    Malaysia's external debts total 48 to 49 billion ringgitand its debt service ratio exceeds 20 pct, the Development Bankof Singapore Ltd, one of Singapore's four major local banks,said in a report released this week.    Azraai said: "While the growth in debt has been rapid inrecent years, it is still within the limits of prudence andconscious efforts have been made and will continue to be madeto decelerate and restrain external borrowings."    He said the Malaysian government is urgently addressing thetwin deficits of the Federal Budget and the balance of paymentswhich followed two recessions in the 1980s.    Azraai said Malaysia's public sector deficit had risen dueto the contraction in the government's resources as well as therapid growth in public expenditures.    With declining incomes and export earnings, the bases forresource generation became limited, and the government will notraise taxes because current tax margins are high compared toMalaysia's neighbours, he said.    "As such the remaining avenue for rationalising andconsolidating the budget is through expenditure reductions," hesaid.    Azraai said the Malaysian government's developmentexpenditures were cut by about 25 pct in 1987, while those ofstate enterprises were reduced by 41 pct.    He said: "A commitment has been undertaken to reduce thebudget deficit over time and to balance the Federalgovernment's budget current account deficit by 1989."    Malaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin presented abudget for 1987 which foresees a deficit of 9.4 billionringgit, down from 11.6 billion in 1986, with federal spendingtargetted at 27.4 billion, down from 30.8 billion, and revenueat 18 billion against 19.2 billion.    Azraai said the government will cut the size of the publicsector and privatize those operations which may be better runby the private sector. New measures have been introduced toboost the private sector and attract foreign investment.    A higher proportion of foreign ownership, even up to 100pct, is now possible for new investments in the manufacturingsector made between October 1986 and December 1990, he said.    "The long term prospects of the Malaysian economy are bright... Indications are already available to show that the economyis recovering and that growth will be positive and strongerthan originally expected," Azraai said.

Zhao told the annual meeting of the National People'sCongress that while China cooled its overheated economy, cutits trade deficit and raised national living standards in 1986,serious imbalances remain.    Zhao said total social demand exceeds total supply, anddemand for consumer goods, especially from state firms, is toohigh. "(They) squander public funds to a serious extent ... (andissue) excessive wage and bonus increases," he said.    Failure to cut this excess will "result in reducedaccumulation of funds...And serve to corrupt social morality,"Zhao said. He said there was a contradiction between low percapita incomes and excessively high consumer demand.    China needs to accumulate enormous funds for constructionin its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumptionmust match the available resources, he said.    Zhao said there was a deficit in state finances in 1986because of the sharp fall in world oil prices, the rising costof foreign exchange earnings through exports, reduced incomefrom customs duties and unreasonably heavy spending.    Local authorities, departments and firms have been able toretain more revenue since economic reforms in 1979. "(They)unjustifiably developed processing industries andnon productive construction," Zhao said.    He said that unless effective measures are taken to curbthis practice, financial and credit deficits are likely toincrease in the next few years.    Zhao said that if such deficits become excessive and lasttoo long, they will cause the over issue of money, which inturn will cause "disturbing inflation, a precipitous rise incommodity prices and chaos in economic life."    Another serious problem is that too many new constructionprojects have been launched. Fixed asset investment outside thestate plan is over extended and the pattern of such investmentis highly irrational, he said.    Investment in energy, transport, telecommunications and rawand semi finished materials industries is inadequate andinvestment in non productive projects is too large, he said.     Zhao said some departments and local authorities havefailed to take prompt and effective measures to correct thisinvestment imbalance, despite instructions to do so from theState Council earlier this year.     He said China's per capita output of grain and other farmand sideline products is still very low and production ofgrain, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries rests on arather weak foundation.     China's countryside is still in the development stage andthere is vast potential to be tapped through deep reforms, hesaid, but did not elaborate.    Zhao said the main task for reform in 1987 is to breathelife into China's large and medium sized state firms, whichstill do not have "a satisfactory combination ofresponsibilities, powers and benefits."    "We have yet to create conditions for giving the enterprisesfull managerial authority and full responsibility for their ownprofits and losses," he said.    Currently, the firms are not responding rationally tomarket changes and doing all the state requires of them, hesaid. Their potential is not being fully tapped, he added.    Zhao said that in 1987, China will speed up the reform ofits financial system, diversify credit services, encouragecompetition among different financial institutions and promoteinsurance services.    He said the system of bank interest rates must be reformed,with differential and floating rates being applied fordifferent periods of time.    China must, under proper guidance, develop markets for thecirculation of funds in major cities and exploit the role offinancial markets in pooling and regulating funds, he added.    Zhao said China must also expand the market for capitalgoods such as rolled steel, coal, cement and timber. The lackof such a market is the main reason why large state firms have"yet to be fully invigorated," he said.    He also promised a continuation of the labour contractsystem under which all firms hire workers for a fixed periodand pay them according to their own methods, subject only tostate set ceilings for wages and bonuses.

The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted adomestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.    It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mlnmark write back of reserves that had been created to coverpossible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessarybecause of recent declines in raw material prices.    Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall inprices as well as the lower value of the dollar.    It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinaryshare capital, which is entirely in private hands and heldlargely by family foundations.

Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, whichproduce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected thenew pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubberindustries remain viable in the long term.    But traders and growers said they were against the new pactbecause its buffer stock mechanism was likely to intereferewith free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises.    The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires onOctober 22, was formally adopted by most of the world'sproducers and consumers in Geneva last Friday.    It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters inNew York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enterinto force provisionally when ratified by countries accountingfor 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.    Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik saidthe formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears ofliquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubberand a possible depression of prices.    He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue tokeep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices roseor fell through its buffer stock system.    Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing ofpurchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and acontingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be donethrough direct cash contributions from members, he said.    Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks tofinance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewedwith concern by some members who fear the INRA may becomeindebted and ultimately face collapse, like the InternationalTin Agreement.    "This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried outwithout any financial encumbrance," Lim said.     Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seekingcabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producersand consumers would also become members, he said.    Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefitto Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices.    It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement becauseits new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.    Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the newpact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debtthe INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his marketoperations.     Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a freerubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices atlevels that were only acceptable to consumers.    "With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stablelevel, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,while producers may never see sharp price rises," a MalaysianRubber Producers Council source told Reuters.    Producers also wanted a free rubber market without theoverhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which hadpsychologically prevented price rises, he said.    State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices hadbeen depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of abuffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.    Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it wasexpensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.    Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might bepressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential tostabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producersto produce more.    Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact'sconclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely toallow sharp price fluctuations in future.    "The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must beliquidated and a free market returned," a Malaysian trader said.    Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for successas most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but theyquestioned the ability of some financially strapped producersto finance buffer stock operations.

He told reporters:"1987 has started well for Cathay PacificAirways which looks forward to another good year... SwireProperties expects further good results both from propertiesunder development for sale and from its investment propertyportfolio."    He did not give any specific projections for earnings. Thecompany earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago.    Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrsmainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay PacificAirways Ltd CAPH.HKG>.    Miles said the company will use the money to develop itsbusiness, primarily in Hong Kong.    Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of theenlarged capital to the state owned China International Trustand Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.    Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay'sflights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.    He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of "amarginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled withsavings in fuel costs."    "At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stablefor the rest of this year," he said, "though there might be a bitof increase later this year.''    Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil serviceoperations, even though the marine sector is generallydepressed. "Obviously the marine industry is not getting anybetter," he said.    The real estate market remained strong and Swire last yearrevalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared withan increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year.    Miles said he expects the property market to remain firmbut said the firm has no available land for a major housingproject such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kongisland now near completion.    He said the company's 50 pct unit Hongkong United DockyardLtd> is negotiating with the government for the development ofan existing petroleum storage depot into a major housingestate. "But it's not as big as Taikoo Shing," he said.

They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaisedes Petroles (Total) TPN.PA>, whose Total Abu al Bukhooshsubsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on thereopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.    Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi,last November 25.    The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main livingquarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main productionplatform.    Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsiblebut Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq.    Abu al Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd)at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resumeat a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff andthe fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.    The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed inremaining accomodations, the sources said.    Facilities being installed to protect the field includeaircraft detection equipment, anti aircraft missiles, housingfor military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sourcessaid.    Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United ArabEmirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15mln bpd production, the sources said.    They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field,part of the same reservoir as Abu al Bukhoosh and located onlya few miles away. Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi airraid only 10 days before Abu al Bukhoosh was attacked.

The planned three billion baht issue would carry a term ofsix months to one year as a short term move to mop up surplusfunds held by commercial banks.    The issue would offer a coupon attractive to commercialbanks, which currently have an estimated 30 to 60 billion bahtin funds invested in low yield securities, the sources said.    The central bank, charged with supervision of commercialbanks, has previously issued only Finance Ministry bonds.    Private bankers said they are awaiting a central bankdecision on whether to allow commercial banks to continueholding up to 40 pct of their capital in foreign exchange or toreturn it to 20 pct as scheduled.    The six month 40 pct ceiling expires April 6 but the bankswant it extended for six more months.    They said a forced cut in foreign exchange positions wouldworsen the local liquidity problem as commercial banks wouldhave to convert about five billion baht worth of foreigncurrencies in their portfolios into baht.    Senior central bank officials suggested to reporters lastweek that the foreign exchange ceiling will be lowered todiscourage banks' use of excess funds for currency speculation.    Central bank sources said some commercial banks,anticipating such a central bank decision, have been convertingtheir foreign currencies into baht this week and lending theadditional funds to the Bank of Thailand's short term loanrepurchase facility.    They said the Bank of Thailand's repurchase windowyesterday received offers of about three billion baht ofinvestment funds from commercial banks, three times its normaldaily amount.    The repurchase window uses government bonds as aninstrument with which commercial banks can borrow from or lendto the state bank.    The facility is sometimes used by the central bank to set alocal short term interest benchmark through fixing its bondrepurchase rates.

Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential JapanFederation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), toldreporters: "The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar).The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economyis not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan)."    "The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S.Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as theAmerican situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise," hesaid.    To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen,Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means,including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said.    He rejected recent calls from some government quarters forwage increases this year as a means of raising privateconsumption and thus boosting domestic demand.    "We have to keep wages as low as possible," he said.    He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressingthe outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in additionto hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic marketmanufacturers through cheap imports.    Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsukisaid.    Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and adownturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect serviceindustries, he said.    It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fullyemploy those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, hesaid.    Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall inthe business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possiblerecession in the Japanese economy, he said.    Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyondlevels experienced in 1986.    The government's Economic Planning Agency said last weekthe economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performancesince 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oilprice crisis.    In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost theeconomy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of landand reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along withsteps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.

He added that "no one should expect any dramaticdevelopments before March 31."    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68billion dlrs debt to commercial banks and froze short termtrade and money market lines.    Bankers said they would relay the Brazilian request for anextension but declined to say whether they were specificallyendorsing it.    Gros said the decision, which he called a "standstill"arrangement, will be communicated to Brazil's 700 bankcreditors by telex tomorrow. Banks had been pressing Brazil tomake at least a token interest payment, but Gros said thegovernment was unable to comply for the moment.    He stressed however that Brazil was willing to pay as soonas it could, but added that a payment of interest was notconnected with the extension of the credit lines.    "That would not be wise," he said.    He said that the extension of the short term lines wouldnot be carried out through "an official instrument" as there wasnot time to complete the legal requirements.    Gros said Brazil was likely to meet again with the 14 bankadvisory committee once Brazil had information to present on aneconomic plan.

Central Bank governor Francisco Gros said after a meetingwith a 14 bank advisory committee that Brazil cannot make anyinterest payments at this time, though it would do so "as soonas we can."    The talks came as the annual meeting of the 44 nationInter American Development Bank (IADB), in which both Gros andthe bankers had been taking part, moved toward a close here.    Bankers leaving the meeting with Gros declined to discussdetails of the talks, though some expressed satisfaction thatBrazil had agreed to continue working with the committee.    At the same time, Gros told reporters not to expect anydramatic developments before March 31, the date when some U.S.banks have said they will take a decision whether to put Brazilloans on a non performing basis.    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrforeign debt to commercial banks on February 20 and shortlyafter announced it was freezing some 16 billion dlrs inshort term credit lines.    Banks are not obliged to declare these loans non performingbefore 90 days have elapsed, but the move to announce apossible decision in this respect was viewed as a means ofexerting pressure on Brazil.    The bank committee, headed by Citibank, had been pressingBrazil to make at least a token payment of interest but Grossaid this was not possible right now.    "We are not in a position to make a payment at this stage,"Gros said.    At the same time, the two sides reached a stopgaparrangement on the short term trade and money market creditlines, whereby the committee agreed to transmit a Brazilianrequest to extend the lines for 60 days until May 31.    Banks have been indicating they will not renew credit linesin response to the Brazilian move.

Zhao said China's price system is irrational due to"prolonged negligence of the law of value and due to the rigidand excessive state control."    "The prices of farm products, energy, raw and semi finishedmaterials and other primary products have long been too low andmany products have long been in short supply," he said.    Price reforms are necessary to "establish a new vigoroussocialist economic structure, to effectively promote productionand commodity circulation and provide correct guidance toconsumption," Zhao added.    Reforms are bound to lead to a rise in the general pricelevel but will only be implemented after careful studies so asto keep the increase within the capacity of society and thepeople "to withstand the strain."     He said the general price level will rise in 1987 lessthan in 1986, with price increases of a very small number ofproducts.

Indeed, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of allnew debt issued here last year   over 186 billion dlrs worth  was part of either an interest rate or currency swap.    "The U.S. Treasuries market here is swap driven," said DavidJones, vice president at Goldman Sachs and Co international andhead of its U.S. Government bond trading desk.    "It is commonplace to have trades of 100 mln dlrs or more in10 years, seven years or five years, all related to an interestrate swap or hedging of a eurobond deal," Jones said at a recentconference on the U.S. Treasuries market.    Just a year or so ago, he said, trades of that size goingthrough brokers screens in London were unthinkable.    Traders said that over the past two weeks, while trading inU.S. Treasuries has been almost frozen by indecision over thedirection of interest rates, swap related deals have providedthe sole source of new business.    Dealers said that last week, a 260 mln dlr trade involvingtwo and 10 year Treasuries was transacted on brokers' screens.    The trade, they said, was swap related.    There are no firm figures on exactly how much U.S. Treasurydebt is traded here and estimates vary widely.    But Wrightson Economics, a U.S. based research firm whichdrew its data from U.S. Treasury reports, estimated that grosstransactions in U.S. Government securities in London rose to341 billion dlrs in the first nine months of 1986 alone,against 188 billion in all of 1985.    Wrightson estimates that about 20 pct of all U.S. Treasurytrading is transacted outside the U.S., With Tokyo forming thethird major centre.    And while figures are not yet available for the lastquarter, the anecdotal evidence suggests that the trendcontinued, traders say.    Richard Lacy, chief executive at Exco International, putaverage daily Treasuries trading volume in London at about 15billion dlrs. Exco recently purchased an 80 pct interest in RMJSecurities inc, one of the four major brokers in U.S.Government bonds which has offices in London, New York andTokyo.    But Dick Van Splinter, president of RMJ's competitor,Fundamental Brokers Inc's London operations, estimates averagedaily turnover is no more than four to five billion dlrs.    But even at the low range of estimates, Treasuries tradingvolume is at least equal to that in the U.K.'s own governmentbonds, known as gilts.     Jeremy Ford, vice president at Bankers Trust InternationalLtd, explained that U.S. Treasuries are used by intermediariesin swap transactions to lock in the "spread," the differencebetween the interest rate the borrower has to pay and the ratethat the counterparty is obliged to pay.    But even beyond swap related activity, dealers said thenature of trading in London has changed.    "The interesting thing our figures show is the transition inLondon from a marketing effort to a trading effort," said LouisCrandall, an economist at Wrightson who has been collecting thedata.    Crandall said that previously, firms' activities werelimited to trying to sell U.S. Securities to Europeaninvestors. Now, however, they appear increasingly willing actas principal in transactions rather than acting on behalf oftheir New York offices.    Increasingly, traders say, firms maintain separate profitand loss sheets for their London operations so that tradingdecisions can be made independently from the U.S. Headquarters.    Many of the major U.S. Firms, including Merrill Lynch andCo, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc and Chemical Bank trade fortheir own accounts here.    Also, traders point out, the number of U.S. Firms operatingin London has increased sharply over the past year, as has thenumber of European and Asian banks which trade U.S. Governmentsecurities.    Within the past few months, NationalWestminster Bank Plc's County Bank subsidiary and Swiss BankCorp have applied to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York tobecome primary dealers in U.S. Government securities and theirLondon offices have just recently received direct dealingbrokers screens.    And Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, already a primary dealer, ispreparing to open a U.S. Treasuries trading desk in London.    Dick Van Splinter, president of Fundamental Brokers Inc,the largest of the four major government bond brokers here,said he now has 45 firms using direct dealing screens, up from35 a year ago.

Short Brothers is owned by the British Government.    Junior Foreign Officer Minister Timothy Eggar dismissed theclaims as "wild and fanciful allegations" with no foundation.    Foulkes said North testified he was seeking the help of "ahead of an allied government" in obtaining the Blowpipes andsuggested the supply of missiles was discussed during twomeetings which he said took place between North, the then headof the CIA William Casey and Thatcher in 1986.

The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNGon the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he toldthe Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annualconference.    Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East WestCenter in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia Pacificpetroleum outlook.    With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd)and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991,PNG would become an Ecuador level crude exporter, Fesharakisaid.    The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the bestoil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG.    The PNG government's Geological Survey in a paperdistributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves atabout 500 mln barrels.    PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region withno secondary taxes, Fesharaki said.    "We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, anddiscovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to(light) Bass Strait crude," Fesharaki said.    There are also large pockets of high quality condensates tobe produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which iscapable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said.    But prices should be somewhat higher than the presentlevels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.    The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five largeprospective but little explored sedimentary basins in PNG.

Zhao told the annual meeting of the National People'sCongress that while China cooled its overheated economy, cutits trade deficit and raised national living standards in 1986,serious imbalances remain.    Zhao said total social demand exceeds total supply, anddemand for consumer goods, especially from state firms, is toohigh. "(They) squander public funds to a serious extent ... (andissue) excessive wage and bonus increases," he said.    Failure to cut this excess will "result in reducedaccumulation of funds...And serve to corrupt social morality,"Zhao said. He said there was a contradiction between low percapita incomes and excessively high consumer demand.    China needs to accumulate enormous funds for constructionin its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumptionmust match the available resources, he said.    Zhao said there was a deficit in state finances in 1986because of the sharp fall in world oil prices, the rising costof foreign exchange earnings through exports, reduced incomefrom customs duties and unreasonably heavy spending.    Investment in energy, transport, telecommunications and rawand semi finished materials industries is inadequate andinvestment in non productive projects is too large, he said.

The U.K. Market has managed a dizzy rise since the NewYear, with the FT SE index of 100 leading shares lifting 22.5pct since January 2 to current levels around 2050.    "Over the next month or two the odds are that the index willdrop back to around 1,900," said John Goldschmidt, head ofequities research at Chase Manhattan Securities.    "A five to 10 pct drop is likely. There was a six pct fallbefore the 1983 election when the Conservatives were furtherahead in the polls and the market was on a multiple of only 14instead of 18 now," noted Nick Knight of brokers James Capel.    "The old adage is "sell in May and go away'. That's likely toapply this year but will probably start in April," he added.    But few analysts believed a correction would spell the endof the bull run that has now lasted for some six years.    "As long as corporate profits and earnings keep on growingthen the pressure for continued rises will be there. Thereseems little prospect of the growth stopping in 1987/1988," onesaid.    Much of the recent enthusiasm has stemmed from the belief,already virtually discounted, that the ruling Conservativeswill call an election in the next few months   probably June  and sweep home to a third term in office.    Even if this does happen, however, pre election nerves arelikely to produce the traditional effect of damping down themarket until the result is clear.    "It's likely there will be one or two hiccups of confidenceabout the Tories winning an overall majority," Goldschmidt said.    "It would be quite out of character for the market tocontinue to sail serenely upwards right through the electionand beyond," added brokers Phillips and Drew in a recent report.    The belief that the government itself is worried about theimpact of the Alliance party disrupting the usual two cornerfight of Conservative and Labour with unpredictable results, isnot likely to give reassurance, one analyst noted.    Other factors also indicate that the market is vulnerableto a downwards correction. U.K. Stocks had ridden up partly onthe back of record rises in New York and Japan and a pause ineither suggests that London would inevitably follow suit.    There would also be little new encouragement provided bygeneral economic factors as much of the recent optimistic news,including this month's half point cut in base rates to 10 pct,is already built into prices.    "The economy is looking okay, but it can't support 20 pctincreases every three months indefinitely," one said.    Also, market liquidity, a powerful driving force behind therecent rises, shows signs of drying up under the pressure ofthe government's privatisation campaign.    The next few months will see cash calls for second tranchepayments on British Gas Plc BRGS.L> and British Airways PlcBAB.L> as well as the proposed sale of Rolls Royce Plc> andthe as yet untimetabled sale of the government's 31.7 pct stakein British Petroleum Co Plc BP.L>.    On top of that, there will be calls from the gilt marketeven though last week's budget limited the projected 1987/88borrowing requirement to four billion stg.    "We are looking for a squeeze on cash flow, and that's notincluding rights issues which have been low so far this yearand may pick up in the second quarter," Knight said.

The five year bond, for Inspectorate International FinanceNV, gives investors options on two separate warrant series "A"and "B" exercisable into participation certificates in parent andguarantor Inspectorate International AG.    The first "A" series carries warrants for four participationcertificates. Upon exercising the "A" warrants, investors alsoget two warrants for the "B" series.    The "A" exercise period runs from May 7, 1987, to August 6,1987. The exercise price is 543 Swiss francs.    Of the two "B" warrants, one entitles investors to purchaseone participation certificate in Inspectorate International AGand the other provides seven warrants.    Investors may pay for "B" participation certificates byredeeming the bond issued today. In this case, the bond, issuedin denominations of 5,000 marks, will be valued at a fixedprice of 4,200 Swiss francs, or 119.05 francs per 100 marks.    Participation certificates acquired with "B" warrants will bepriced at 597 francs, equalling the price of the first tranche,plus a 10 pct premium. The exercise period for the "B" series isfrom August 8, 1987 to May 5, 1991.    Fees for the bond total 2 1/4 pct, with 1 1/2 points forselling, and 1 3/4 for management and underwriting combined.    Investors will pay for the bond on April 8, and the bondpays annual interest on the same day. It matures on April 8,1992. The bond and warrants will be listed in Frankfurt.    If all participation share warrants are exercised, thecompany will obtain some 300 mln marks in new equity.    The construction allows Inspectorate to borrow at lowercost than a comparable convertible bond and will give theInspectorate equity through issues of participationcertificates in West Germany, a Swiss Bank Corp spokesman said.    Inspectorate requires funding to finance its purchase of a51 pct stake in Harpener AG, a diversified West German group,and other recent acquisitions.

The dollar intervention was in concert with some othercentral banks, they said.    Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of Englandsupported the dollar against the yen earlier today and thatthese two banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve were also activeyesterday.    The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers' remarks.    Dealers said the intervention underlined the determinationof central banks to keep currencies within recent rangesfollowing last month's agreement in Paris by six leadingcountries to foster currency stability.    One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with theBundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buydollars after the Japanese and U.K. Central bank moves.    He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing thesituation to see if it should intervene in consultation withother central banks.    Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar haduntil yesterday traded in a 1.8150 1.8700 mark range, and above150 yen, with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to testcentral banks' resolve to defend currency stability.    But the test came this week with the dollar falling below1.81 marks and 150 yen. Dealers said a reviving trade disputebetween Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that thedollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U.S.Trade deficit were behind the weakness.    This week's intervention showed central banks were preparedto cooperate to defend the Paris pact, dealers said.    Dealers said it was significant the West German and Britishcentral banks were supporting the dollar against the yen.    That showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation bycentral banks to foster currency stability, they said.    But it was unclear how such cooperation was being arrangedand how frequent consultations between central banks were.

The move, announced one day after news of a first steptoward integration of financial market supervision in theNetherlands, will involve new transaction and clearing andsettlement systems.    In addition, the bourse's Amsterdam InterprofessionalMarket (AIM) information system will be updated in short termwith software provided by the Chicago Midwest Stock Exchange.    The Amsterdam bourse is also studying the possibleacquisition of Midwest Exchange software for a neworder routing system, a statement said, noting the market hereremains firmly committed to the preservation of a tradingfloor.    "The Bourse management feels that, despite the discussionstriggered by the intended closure of the trading floor inLondon, preparations for an overhaul of the trading floor inAmsterdam have to continue," the statement said.    The operational modernisation of the Amsterdam StockExchange follows several liberalisation measures aimed atstemming the flow of business to markets abroad.    The liberalisation, particularly the introduction ofoff floor trading in stocks and bonds on a net basis under theAIM system, has been described by bourse officials asAmsterdam's "little bang," a reference to sweeping reforms lastOctober on the London Stock Exchange known as Big Bang.    AIM, started in a trial run early last year and officiallyin force from January 1 this year, is already credited withhalting the growth in Dutch stocks traded abroad, mainlyLondon.    Amsterdam, which feels an on floor facility with fees isvital for smaller investors, said it needs to overhaul thefloor to accommodate new technology and new members.    A new floor layout and order routing system should be readysometime next year, the statement said.    It said it was also planning a new on screen CentralSecurities information System with prices from internationalexchanges, including the U.S. And Japan, stock information andcompany news.    Yesterday, the bourse announced it would start coordinatingthis summer market supervision with the options and futurestrade in the Netherlands as a first step toward a unifiedfinancial markets watchdog. In addition, the bourse, optionsand gold futures price lists will be merged this April.    Transactions in Amsterdam are still processed with a nowoutdated punch card system while price information stemmingfrom the larger off floor deals done through AIM are not yetintegrated in the bourse's big board.    A bourse spokesman said the exchange hoped to launch itsscreen information service by 1989, but added this service didnot have first priority.    At present, bourse price information and companyinformation announced by the bourse are published by a printerservice while a select number of prices is available viateletext.

"We have not gone from "no confidence" to "full confidence" yet,"commented one banker, who saw the agreement as having marginalinfluence on fundamental economic problems.    Money market analysts cited the debt renegotiation as themain impetus behind increases today in both the commercial andfinancial rand.    The commercial rand, used for current account transactions,rose 0.5 cts to 49 U.S. Cts while the financial rand jumpednearly two cts to 33 U.S. Cts.    All equity and fixed investment flows of foreigners takeplace through the financial rand, which is considered the mainbarometer of South Africa's attractiveness to overseasinvestors.    Analysts predicted the debt arrangement plus further gainsin the gold price could push the commercial rand over 50 U.S.Cts and the financial rand to 35 cents in the next few weeks.    They said the financial rand in particular was being drivenby a tentative provision in the new debt agreement that couldfavourably affect the currency.    Foreign creditors may get permission to convert loanbalances and short term claims into equity investments in SouthAfrica.    Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said the Reserve Bankwas "investigating the implications of such conversions in lightof terms and restrictions of the financial rand system."    Du Plessis in disclosing the new agreement last night saidthe recent sharp rise in the financial rand was an example that"some foreign investors are again taking a more realistic viewof South Africa."    Terms of the debt agreement call for South Africa to repay1.42 billion dlrs of 13 billion dlrs of frozen debt over thenext three years. The agreement extends a standstillarrangement, expiring June 30, that has been in place sinceAugust, 1985.    Bankers said the repayment amounts essentially confirmedtheir private estimates and could be comfortably met by themonetary authorities.    "They (creditors) asked for the maximum amount and weoffered the minimum," said one banking source, reacting toreports from London that creditors were hoping for largerrepayments.    Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said South Africashould have "no difficulty whatsoever" with the terms.    Economists said the debt agreement would have nosignificant impact on economic problems continuing to faceSouth Africa including high rates of inflation andunemployment, labour unrest and political uncertainty.    Johannesburg Stock Exchange president Tony Norton, speakingyesterday before the debt agreement, said the economy was "inbad shape" and there was "an awful lot of talk but little action"to cure serious problems.

The committee's consideration of one of the mostcontroversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surpluscountries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States,was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, itssponsor Rep. Richard Gephardt said.    Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, told Reuters he was notcertain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposalwould take. Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries suchas Japan.    The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces PresidentReagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violateinternational trade agreements but it allows him to waveretaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S.economy.    The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisionsto grant domestic industries import relief.    It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign tradepractices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. Thesepowers are currently held by President Reagan.    The administration has strongly objected to this transferof authority from Reagan to Yeutter.    The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiatemultilateral trade agreements. The bill will be wrapped intoother trade legislation and voted on in the House in April.

"We have not gone from 'no confidence' to 'full confidence'yet," commented one banker, who saw the agreement as havingmarginal influence on fundamental economic problems.    Money market analysts cited the debt renegotiation as themain impetus behind increases today in both the commercial andfinancial rand.    The commercial rand, used for current account transactions,rose 0.5 cts to 49 U.S. Cts while the financial rand jumpednearly two cts to 33 U.S. Cts.    All equity and fixed investment flows of foreigners takeplace through the financial rand, which is considered the mainbarometer of South Africa's attractiveness to overseasinvestors.    Analysts predicted the debt arrangement plus further gainsin the gold price could push the commercial rand over 50 U.S.Cts and the financial rand to 35 cents in the next few weeks.    They said the financial rand in particular was being drivenby a tentative provision in the new debt agreement that couldfavorably affect the currency.    Foreign creditors may get permission to convert loanbalances and short term claims into equity investments in SouthAfrica.    Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said the Reserve Bankwas "investigating the implications of such conversions in lightof terms and restrictions of the financial rand system."    Du Plessis in disclosing the new agreement last night saidthe recent sharp rise in the financial rand was an example that"some foreign investors are again taking a more realistic viewof South Africa."    Terms of the debt agreement call for South Africa to repay1.42 billion dlrs of 13 billion dlrs of frozen debt over thenext three years. The agreement extends a standstillarrangement, expiring June 30, that has been in place sinceAugust, 1985.    Bankers said the repayment amounts essentially confirmedtheir private estimates and could be comfortably met by themonetary authorities.    "They (creditors) asked for the maximum amount and weoffered the minimum," said one banking source, reacting toreports from London that creditors were hoping for largerrepayments.    Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said South Africashould have "no difficulty whatsoever" with the terms.    Economists said the debt agreement would have nosignificant impact on economic problems continuing to faceSouth Africa including high rates of inflation andunemployment, labour unrest and political uncertainty.    Johannesburg Stock Exchange president Tony Norton, speakingyesterday before the debt agreement, said the economy was "inbad shape" and there was "an awful lot of talk but little action"to cure serious problems.

The bill, approved by voice vote, would establish trademissions made up of representatives of the Departments ofAgriculture and State, the Agency for InternationalDevelopment, the Overseas Private Investment Corp, marketdevelopment cooperatives and private voluntary organizations.    At least 16 missions would have to be sent within one yearafter enactment of the bill. The missions would promote U.S.programs, including PL480, Section 416 donations, ExportEnhancement Program, the dairy export incentive program, andexport credit guarantee programs (GSM 102, GSM 103).    The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill,offered by Sen. John Melcher (D Mont.), that would haverequired the U.S. Agriculture Department to donate at least onemln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries.    Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750,000 tonnesof surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 fooddonation program.    The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposedincrease in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost upto 50 mln dlrs per year, Senate staff said.    The committee also dropped a provision identifying whichcountries would be the focus of the trade missions' activities.    Under the bill adopted by the committee, countries "friendlyto the United States" would be eligible to host the trademissions.    Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico,the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Nigeria, Peru,Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela,Tunisia and Morocco.    The bill also would require the Foreign AgriculturalService, FAS, to have at least 850 full time employees duringfiscal years 1987 89.

BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon tradingafter a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538pearlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39billion pre tax.    Stock market analysts said today's generally weak stockmarket plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BATshares in the run up to the results caused the fall in theshare price.    "In the current market, people almost expect companies tobeat expectations," said one analyst, adding that pretax profitsof 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast.    BAT's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985pretax profit of 1.17 billion.    Brokers noted that BAT's shift away from itsunderperforming industries and the decreasing share of thetobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs.    BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that thetobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74pct four years ago.    Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the companydeclining further as other sectors increased in importance.    He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financialservices, in particular in the U.S.    Sheehy also said the group had "no sizeable acquisitions" insight in the near future.    Analysts said BAT's increasingly good performance in theU.K. Insurance area was encouraging.    Its declining debt to equity ratio of currently about 16pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to makemajor acquisitions, they said.

One measure he said he favored would raise the depletionallowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well asproduction using enhanced extraction methods.    Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year.The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending thetax code, but would look at the proposal.    Herrington's proposals to spur production were made alongwith the release last week of the energy department's report onenergy and the national security.    The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damagingimplications for national security.    He has said since in speeches and at news conferences thatany plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil productionwould have to meet three criteria increase production, notcause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer.    Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test,spurring production but fail the second and third.    He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oilprices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwideand cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs.    A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteriaby not increasing domestic production.    In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remainsfirmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax.    Options which meet Herrington's criteria include:      Loan price guarantees to shield banks from defaults byborrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that ifoil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults thatcould cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.      A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. Itwould raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.      A five pct credit only for geological and geophysicalexpenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels aday, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.      Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage tospur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre forthe typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lowerthe cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.    Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administrationproposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cutthe need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.    He also called again for Congressional approval to exploreoff the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billionbarrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, whichmay hold nine billion barrels.    Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of theseproposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/securitystudy would make a strong case for the need to help thestruggling domestic oil industry.    Another move Herrington said he will press anew, eventhough it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is toraise the fill rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.    This, he said, would further bolster national security incase of an oil supply disruption.

The company said it is also negotiating with its lenders toextend the reduced net worth terms beyond May 15.

Called the NPL, the mini supercomputers use Gould's UTX/32operating system, which is a compatible multi processorextension of the UNIX operating system consisting of completeAT and T System V and Berkeley BSD 4.3 environments, companyofficials said at a teleconference.    "The introduction of the NPL family of mini supercomputers,is by far Gould's most significant computer line developed todate," chairman James McDonald said.    Patrick Rickard, computer systems president, said that heexpects sales of NPL family computers to account for 20 pct ofthe division's revenues for the first year after itsintroduction, and increase to 80 pct of revenues in five years.    Computer operations accounted for one third or about 300mln dlrs of Gould's total revenues for 1986 of 908.8 mln dlrs,a company spokesman said.    The NP1, the first series of the new family, uses an opensystems architecture, including parallel and high speed vectorprocessing and "massive" memory to achieve its supercomputingcapability, Gould officers said.    The NP1 family will form the foundation for new systemswhich are expected to be brought to market through the 1990s,McDonald said.    The computers are expected to have applications in scienceand engineering, in aerospace and defense and extend into otherareas such as medical sciences, Rick Baron, senior director ofmarketing development said.    Gould said it priced and packaged the NP1 at a cost whichwill provide the power and advantages of a traditionalsupercomputer at a fraction of the cost.    The NP1 product line includes several models priced from395,000 dlrs to 2.9 mln dlrs, Gould officials said adding thatthe company has already signed orders for eight NP1 systems.    The low end NP1 models will be available in the 1987 thirdquarter and the high end will be available in the 1988 firstquarter, they said.    According to Gould officials, the NP1 cost 50 mln dlrs todevelop and the company plans to spend between 100 to 150 mlnto develop the rest of the family line. Between now and 1995,the company expects to ship two to three billion dlrs of NP1mini supercomputers.

The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year intothe oil and gas industry and could lead to more than onebillion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.    The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada onor after April 1, 1987.    Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aidpackage is aimed at small and medium sized companies.    The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration andDevelopment Incentive Program, will restrict the total paymentsthat any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.    Masse said the program will probably generate newemployment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.    He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration anddevelopment spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oilprices fell during the first half of 1986.    Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decidedto provide cash incentives so a large number of non tax payingcompanies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the fullvalue of the incentive. Such companies would not immediatelybenefit from tax benefits, he said.    The federal government also wanted to deliver an aidprogram outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilsonis now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce taxreform proposals later this spring.    An important feature of the aid program is a decision tolet companies issue flow through shares, allowing investors tobenefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits toonly participating companies, he said.    Allowing flow through shares under the program will make iteasier for companies to attract investors in exploration anddevelopment, Masse said.    He told reporters his department is still consideringwhether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify forthe subsidy.

Cotting said much of the spending will go towardmodernization of the company''s painting operations at itsSpringfield, Ohio truck assembly plant. The balance will beused to increase productivity at its various facilities.    In answer to a question, Neil Springer, who on April 1becomes chairman of the company's new truck and engine holdingcompany, Navistar International Transportation Corp, said thecompany's goal is to reduce costs 25 pct by 1990.    Noting that purchased material now accounts for 81 pct ofits cost of production, Springer said Navistar intends to entersimilar relationships to one it has with Dana Corp CDN>, inwhich the two companies are coordinating design, manufacture,distribution and service of components to cut costs.    Springer said because of overcapacity in some sectors,price discounting will continue to plague the truckmanufacturing industry.    He said the heavy truck industry is operating at 65 pct ofcapacity, up 10 pct from a year ago with medium truck operatingat 73 pct of capacity, about level with a year ago.    Springer said Navistar itself is operating at "over 70 pctof capacity" in heavy trucks and at more than 90 pct in mediumtrucks.    Asked when Navistar would begin making acquisitions,Springer said "We're ready now, but we have no specifictimetable."    Earlier, at the annual meeting, stockholders gave astanding ovation to retiring Chairman Donald Lennox, who duringan eight year tenure was cited for redirecting the companytoward profitability.

Prices paid for this power under long term contracts signedbefore last year's fall in world oil prices now are more thantwice as high as the actual value of the electricity, PacificGas said.    Under the 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Actutilities are required to buy electricity from cogenerationfacilities, which produce both steam and electricity.    Since 1980, Pacific Gas has signed power purchaseagreements, required by the law, with long term priceguarantees for more than 8,480 megawatts of capacity fromprivate producers, the company said.    About 1,870 MW of that capacity is already on line, andaccounted for about eight pct of the company's total energysales in 1986, Pacific Gas said.    The company said it will ask FERC to amend the rulesrequiring purchase of this power so that the price paid for theelectricity reflects current market values, and that utilitiesbe required to buy only electricity needed in the near term.

A presidential spokesman said President Jose Sarney hadauthorised the government's economic team to prepare the newplan as soon as possible.    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said last night the planwould reflect "an important battle to protect the country'sdevelopment and keep it from recession."    Funaro, who helped lead the anti inflation Cruzado Planlaunched in February 1986, has come under increasing attackover the past few days following the resignation of PlanningMinister Joao Sayad on March 17. Observers say the plan hasfailed to stabilise the country's economy.    Sayad submitted a new package calling for a 90 day pricesand a wage freeze, but met opposition from Sarney and Funaro.    Foreign Ministry sources said the new strategy was beingprepared by economists Persio Arida and Andre Lara Resende,both former Central Bank officials said to have played leadingroles in the Cruzado Plan.   The new plan will define the terms on which Brazil will seekrescheduling of its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.    On February 20, Brazil suspended servicing of 70 billiondlrs of debt to private foreign banks.    Funaro said last night Brazil wants a rescheduling programspread over four years, and added that it had to include newloans to keep the domestic economy growing.    "In the past two years Brazil paid 24 billion dlrs inservicing of its foreign debt, while only getting two billiondlrs in new loans," Funaro said.

"We're moving toward a direction where we couldself destruct (the U.S. sugar program)," Rep. Huckaby, chairmanof the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugarissues, told Reuters in an interview.    Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this yearthey must halt production increases, said he will deliver thesame message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He alsosaid he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.    Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domesticsweetener output increases is an effort to forestall furthercuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.    "I think if we're talking about dropping (the quota)another half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the pointwhere the program might not work," he said.    "Ideally, I'd like to freeze things right where we are,"said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.    A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about thecurrent level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of theU.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar importsholding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.    A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be madeuntil 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.    "I feel like if we didn't expand production, we couldprobably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least throughthe 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),"Huckaby said.    However, much depends on whether high fructose corn syrupproducers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetenermarket from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.    He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners willcapture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market inthe U.S.    But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in theproduction of a new crystalline corn sweetener which furtherexpanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar importsmight be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.    Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refinercompanies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.    "This program is advantageous to the corn users. They havesome natural, legitimate self interest in seeing that theprogram is preserved," Huckaby said.    Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives tothink about how domestic output could be controlled, eitherthrough production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.    Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from theJustice Department to determine if it would be legal to askcorn refiners to limit production.    "I don't know if we will go this route, but if we dothere's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you dothat legally?" he said.    Asked if he would proceed with production controls withoutthe support of corn refiners, Huckaby said "You build a fragilehouse if you do it that way."    Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmershave expanded production, because high sugar price supportmeans returns from sugar are higher than competing crops suchas soybeans and grain.    But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion wouldnot be good policy.    Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches tosugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, theymay be penalized retroactively under any production controllegislation passed next year.    Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes inthe sugar program this year despite a Reagan administrationproposal to drastically slash the program.    "The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don'tthink it will get up a head of steam," Huckaby said.    He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar pricesupport is unlikely to be approved.    Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program,Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaintwith the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against theEuropean Community's sugar policy. He said EC policies are themajor cause of the depressed world sugar market.

Bankworkers' leaders said that a national strike launchedyesterday to press for a 100 pct immediate pay rise and monthlysalary adjustments had the support of most of the 700,000workforce.    The strike today closed the stock exchanges of Sao Pauloand Rio de Janeiro.    For the government the one positive development on thelabour front was the gradual return to work of the nation's40,000 seamen, who began a national strike on February 27.    A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro told Reuters about halfthe seamen had returned to work after accords with 22 companiesand that the strike looked close to an end.    Otherwise the labour scene looked bleak, with the bankstrike posing the most serious problems for Brazil'scrisis laden economy.    "If this goes on for more than a few days it will have aserious effect because normal financial operations will grindto a halt," said a western diplomat in Sao Paulo.    Today Brazil's 50,000 university teachers in the 42 federaluniversities launched a national strike, with a broad politicaldemand as well as a pay claim.    David Fleischer, head of the political science departmentin Brasilia university, told Reuters the National Associationof Higher Education Teachers wanted a full congressionalinquiry into what had happened to government education funds.    He said the universities were strapped for cash and thatthe association suspected the junior partner in the coalitiongovernment, the Liberal Front Party, PFL, of using educationfunds for projects which had helped their candidates inelections. The PFL holds the Education Ministry.    Hardly any sectors of the economy are proving immune to thecurrent labour unrest, caused by the return of high inflation,officially pegged at 33 pct for January February.    Other possible strikes looming include stoppages by oilindustry workers and social security workers.

Combustion said the restructuring at Lummus Crest isexpected to substantially reduce but not eliminate this yearlosses in the Engineering and Construction segment.

They also said the stocks are relatively inexpensive sincefear of the tax and of pending litigation regarding warninglabels for tobacco products have kept many investors awayrecently.    Philip Morris Cos MO> rose 2 5/8 to 87 3/4, RJR NabiscoRJR> 1 1/4 to 57 1/2 and U.S. Tobacco UBO> 7/8 to 27.    "The near term activity of these stocks has been dominatedby external factors such as smoking restriction legislation,concern over liability suits and the possible imposition ofexcise taxes," Dean Witter analyst Lawrence Adelman said. "Butthe feeling is that many of those externals have beendiscounted in the price of the stocks."    Adelman, who issued a positive recommendation on PhilipMorris earlier this week, said there have been indications thatthe Reagan Administration's staunch opposition to tax hikeswould short circuit attempts to tax tobacco.    "The tobaccos do have more risks than regular consumerstocks because of these external factors," Adelman said. "Theyare not for the weak hearted, but they offer a lot of value forthe aggressive investor."    In a market where everyone is looking for affordablestocks, trader Drew Schaefer of Kidder Peabody said, it is nothard to understand why the tobaccos, which have been depressedfor a while in a positive market, are attracting buyers.    Adelman believes one of the better buys is Philip Morris."It is a powerhouse of potential growth in earnings, dividendsand free cash flow. And the stock is cheap now," he said.    Adelman expects Morris to earn eight dlrs a share this yearcompared to 6.20 dlrs a share earned a year ago. In 1988, thecompany should report a profit 10.30 dlrs a share.

But he added that the eventual use of those powers wouldnot be backdated if activated before the end of 1988.    The U.K. Government has consistently opposed the use ofunitary taxation of international business on grounds they arecontrary to internationally accepted principles, laid down bythe United Nations and the OECD, Treasury sources said.    In a written parliamentary answer, Lamont said "in themeantime, progress towards a final resolution of the unitarytax issues will be kept under careful review" by Britain.    "Should it be necessary to take action ... Before December31, 1988, it will not apply to dividends paid before the dateof the announcement of such action. If it is necessary to takeaction thereafter, it will not apply to dividends on or beforeDecember 31, 1988," Lamont said.    The Reagan Administratian published draft legislation latein 1985 to limit states use of unitary taxation to the profitsmade inside the U.S., Known as the "water's edge" method.    In response to that draft legislation, Britain agreed todefer initiating action under its Finance Act 1985   but onlyon the understanding that legislation to resolve the unitarytax issue would be made law and take effect from end December1986.    Then the U.S. Administration said in September 1986 that ithad decided not to pursue Federal legislation, in view of thepassing of legislation in California.    Britain, however, considers the California legislationunsatisfactory, not least because U.K. Business will have topay a fee for the right of not being assessed by the unitarytax method, government sources said.

CBS> president Laurence Tisch and hisbrother Preston, who is President Reagan's postmaster general.    The indictment was handed down by a federal grand jury toin New York.    The three indicted were named as Charles Atkins, WilliamHack and Ernest Grunebaum, all well known promoters of taxshelters. Atkins was well known as an organizer of tax sheltersin the late 1970s and early 1980.    The indictment said that between 1978 and 1983, thedefendants conspired to defraud the government by arranging"rigged and fraudulent" transactions in governmenmt securitiesand false tax deductions based on phony trading losses andinterest expenses.    More than 350 mln dlrs in false deductions were passed onto partners in three tax shelters.    In addition, the defendants sold over 200 mln dlrs in phonytrading losses and interest expenses to other entities andindividuals to be used as tax deductions.    The indictment said that over 1.1 billion dlrs in tradinglosses and interest expenses were generated by the scheme butwere off set by "fictious gains."    Laurence Tisch was said by the indictment to have reporteda net loss of 1.1 mln dlrs. His brother, Preston Tisch,reported a loss of 480,000 dlrs.    None of the three men's clients were charged with anycriminal acts. But should the three be found guilty, theirclients will be required to pay taxes they originally avoidedthrough the tax shelter scheme, plus interest and possiblypenalties.

They said growers now forecast soybean production thisseason at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week'sestimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mlntonnes forecast in mid February.    The new forecast is still higher than last season's recordtotal production.    Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to7.3 mln tonnes   4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecastfor the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.    Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean podsin the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Feprovinces and northern Buenos Aires.    The crop since January has been hit by high temperaturesand inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more emptypods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86record of 3.34 mln hectares.    The state of the crop continued to be good in general untillast week but intense, heavy rains since could have causeddamage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.    Where the rains were less heavy they were consideredbeneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.    The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops insouthern Buenos Aires province but are not expected toinfluence production forecasts.    In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, whererainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maizeand sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.    The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week byrains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, LaPampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.    The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mlnhectares in 1985/86.    The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast atbetween 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.    This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 productionand 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.    The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of thearea sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Airesalthough at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.    A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage isimpossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days ofsunshine dries the fields.    The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.    Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln tonnes.    The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by therains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and startingin La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.    The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.    Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.

Dixons initially ended its 90.25 dlr a share tender offeron March 17 after receiving 54 pct of Cyclops shares.    However, the Securities and Exchange Commission last Fridaypressed Dixons to reopen the offer because the U.K. basedcompany had dropped a condition that at least 80 pct of Cyclopsstock be tendered by the close of the offer.    Dixons then extended the offer until yesterday and earliertoday indicated that a substantial number of tendered Cyclopsshares had been withdrawn, leaving it with only 852,000 shares,or just over 20 pct of the roughly 4.26 mln Cyclops sharesoutstanding.    Dixons said today that it purchased the tendered shares,which, when combined with the shares it already holds, gives ita 21.7 pct stake in Cyclops.

The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral tradingagreement with the United States while protecting Canadianpolitical sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketingsystems, the auto industry and Canada's cultural identity.    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said theresolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed freetrade agreement between the two countries, which are eachother's largest trading partners.    "We need a truly free trade agreement, which means bothcountries have to work toward a deal that is mutuallybeneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement," the TexasDemocrat said in a statement.    "I do not question Canada's right to protect its politicalsovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrasesmean the government of Canada means to take important economicissues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeplyconcerned," he added.    Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways whilethe United States uses only six trade restriction methods. Hesaid if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries getrid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fairand might not win Senate approval.    "I am deeply concerned that when the President visits PrimeMinister (Brian) Mulroney next month, he will be presented withthis kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear   as I didwhen I was in Canada   that only a mutually beneficialagreement will be successful," Bentsen said.    Reagan and Mulroney are scheduled to meet April 5 6 inOttawa.    Bentsen urged Mulroney to withdraw a proposal that wouldban imports of independently produced films into Canada bynon Canadians, which the senator called a protectionistmeasure.

"Our position with respect to the dollar goes back to theParis Agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadlyconsistent with underlying economic conditions," Baker told aSenate committee.    Baker continued, "We said further that we and others arewilling to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchangerates around those levels."    He referred to a February agreement by six leadingindustrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters.    Baker refused to answer a question whether Japan andGermany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economiesfor the United States to support the dollar.    "I will not comment because the foreign exchange marketreads more or less than is intended in my statements," Bakersaid.    Baker said that the other signatories recognized that theymust carry their share of the load of correcting externalimbalances that have hindered the world's economy.    He cited news reports that Germany would increase aproposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks tostimulate domestic growth.    Japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures afterthe Japanese budget was made final.

But Assistant Transportation Secretary Matthew Scocozzasaid at a Senate antitrust committee hearing he would notobject to a transfer of the department's authority over airlinemergers to the Justice Department.    Scocozza and Deputy Assistant Attorney General RogerAndewelt said both departments felt airlines should be judgedunder the same antitrust standards as all other industries.    The Transportation Department is due to lose its authorityin 1989, but subcommittee chairman Howard Metzenbaum wants itshifted now because he feels the Department has approved toomany airline mergers.    "Airline mergers have proceeded at a breakneck pace withbarely a whimper being uttered by the Department ofTransportation. Nine airlines control 94 per cent of themarket," the Ohio Democrat said.    Metzenbaum said he was concerned about the effects thepending U.S. Air Piedmont Airlines merger would have onservice, especially at Dayton, Ohio, a major Piedmont hub.    Scocozza said even with the recent mergers, such as TexasAir Corp's acquisition of Eastern Air Lines and People Express,more airlines were flying now in the United States than beforethe 1978 airline deregulation act.    "Airline deregulation has worked, is working, and, giventhe department's commitment to preserving a competitiveenvironment, will continue to work," Scocozza said.    He said the department considers the effect each mergerwill have on competition over all the routes involved and willnot approve a merger which will reduce competition.    Scocozza said most of the recent mergers involved airlinesin financial difficulty being taken over by other carriers.     Andewelt said he was optimistic competition would increaseas airlines expanded airport hubs and routes and believed theindustry did not need special treatment under antitrust laws.    "It is time to treat the airline industry in precisely thesame way as other U.S. industries; any differences are notsignificant for the purpose of merger analysis," Andewelt said.

OMB Deputy Director Joseph Wright said the administrationthis year plans to turn over to private credit rating firmsdata on about 3.5 mln "deadbeats" who are seriously behind or indefault in their payments on federal loans.    Next year, the government will turn over to privatecollection bureaus four billion dlrs in bad education loans andthree billion dlrs in other bad government loans, Wright said.    The government is also considering letting individuals makepayments on their student loans with credit cards, officialstold reporters.    The Internal Revenue Service is already studying the use ofcredit cards to pay income taxes, but this usage would requirea change in federal law while no congressional action would beneeded for credit cards to be used for student loans, theofficials said.    The officials disclosed these plans in releasing the thirdannual OMB report to Congress on management of the U.S.government.    The report details steps to be taken by the administrationto increase federal efficiency and to continue PresidentReagan's highly publicized "war on waste, fraud and abuse."    According to the report, elinquent U.S. debt had soared to68.3 billion dlrs, or 18.8 pct of total receivables, by the endof the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30. At the end offiscal 1981, when Reagan took office, bad debt stood at 29.8billion dlrs or 12.3 pct of total debt.

Under the decision announced today by TransportationSecretary Elizabeth Dole, automakers will be required to meetfederal passive restraint requirements only on the driver'sside. "The action we are taking today will result in theinstallation of more air bags, sooner than would have occurredwithout this rule," Dole said.    Under the ruling announced today, 10 pct of model year 1987cars must have automatic seat belts or air bags on the driver'sside. For the 1988 model year, 25 pct must have passiverestraints, and for 1989, 40 pct must be so equipped.    By the 1990 model year, all new cars must be equipped withpassive restraint systems on the driver's side.    For the passenger side of the front seat, ordinary seatbelts will suffice until 1994 under the new ruling.

The company said "this could bring earnings for 1987 belowColumbia's stated goal of earning no less than its 3.18 dlrsper share dividend." It earned 2.12 dlrs a share in 1986.    It said management expects to recommend to the board thatthe dividend rate be maintained in 1987.    Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may beoffset by a one time accounting change rleated to future taxliabilities under the new federal tax laws.    The company recorded these liabilities based on older,higher tax rates, but an action being considered by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain ofabout 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987, it explained.    "Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987earnings goal   although not in the way originally planned,"Columbia Gas said.    Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit therecovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia GasTransmission Corp, the company's principal pipeline subsidiary.    It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchasedgas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related toamortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchasecontracts. These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiaryfailed to sufficiently support cost recovery.    The company said its subsidiary is not precluded frommaking a new filing to provide sufficient support.

The officials, asking not to be identified, said thegovernment will investigate an industry contention that steel imported from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan is beingdiverted to the U.S. and ultimately exasperating concerns aboutthe level of Canadian exports south of the border.    But the senior officials, asking not to be indentified,said that despite intense pressure from the ReaganAdministration, Ottawa was not considering any kind of formallimits on Canadian shipments to the U.S.    "In a sense what I hope we are doing is buying some time,"said one official who claimed Canadian companies were "fairtraders" in the big American market.    If approved by the Canadian cabinet, the officials said a monitoring system will be established in the next three or fourmonths.    "I guess if we find trans shipment is a problem, we wouldhave to do something about it," said a trade official.    Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pctof the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the leveljust two years ago.    The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time ofgrowing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports fromseveral countries in the face of a decline among domestic steelproducers.    Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of theAmerican market be limited to 2.4 per cent.    The Ontario Government has urged Ottawa to require foreigncompanies to obtain permits to import steel into the country.Currently, import licences are required only for carbon or rawsteel, which makes up less than half the steel market.    Canada exported two billion Canadian dlrs worth of steel in1986, while importing 944 mln dlrs worth of the product in thesame year.

Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegationsindividually in attempt to iron out remaining problems.    Producers and consumers indicated support "in principle" forthe draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the pastweek by a small working group, consumer delegates said.    Despite remaining differences delegates remained confidenta buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when thecouncil session ends, but certain technical points need furtherclarification, the delegates said.    Certain consumers are concerned that differentials includedin the draft buffer stock package are out of line with marketrealities, consumer delegates said.    Unless these are modified there are fears it would promotepurchases of quality cocoas, such as Ghana origin, which arenormally required by manufacturers, they said.    Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non member cocoamight lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa, which woulddepress prices, they added.

Digesting its acquisitions of hotels, Pan Am Corp's Pacificair routes, and Hertz rental cars, combined with stiff air farecompetition has left the company with an undervalued stockprice, analysts said.    The vulnerability of UAL's stock has fueled takeoverspeculation, as have reports that real estate magnate DonaldTrump has bought a large amount of its stock.    Today, a UAL executive told Reuters its chairman RichardFerris spoke with Trump last week. Trump said his interest inthe stock was as an investment, but the executive said thecompany does not know how much Trump owns or whether he has anyother plans.    UAL senior vice president Kurt Stocker said the companybelieves its diversification strategy will work since it canfeed customers from one business to another. Several weeks ago,it announced the new name of Allegis, to be taken in May.    "The strategy that Dick Ferris was talking about a coupleweeks ago when we announced the Allegis name is that the wholereally ends up to be worth more than the sum of the parts.Unfortunately, some people haven't really come to thisunderstanding," Stocker said.    But those same parts   Westin Hotels, Hertz rental cars,United Airlines and its reservation system   also has WallStreet calculating a wide range of breakup values from about100 dlrs per share to 130 dlrs per share.    Analysts aren't so sure the strategy is going to work. Theymention Transworld Corp, initially Trans World Airlines,as an example of an airline diversification gone wrong.Transworld Corp ended up spinning off its TWA airline.Transworld, now TW Services, is selling Hilton International toUAL.    "If you want to be negatively biased you say it's a stupidphilosophy, and if you're United and you put billions of dlrsinto other acquisitions, this is a good idea. There's not muchevidence one way or the other," said Dean Witter analyst MarkDaugherty.    "In the short or long run, they all (UAL's businesses) makemoney and perform well," said Stocker. He said the stock pricehasn't caught on since the strategy is relatively new.    Analysts say it's because earnings are relatively poor.Earnings last year were 25 cts per share. Louis Marckesano ofJanney Montgomery predicts 1987 net of 3.50 dlrs per share.    "They're potential is enormous. I think their problem hasbeen execution. The strike was the single biggest factor thatset them back in 1985. Last year, the whole industry wasinvolved in fare wars. They were hit harder by the fare warsthan anyone else," said Marckesano.    Marckesano said United Airlines was particularly hurt bythe fare wars because it shares a Denver hub with Texas AirCorp's price slashing Continental Airlines.    Analysts said the same strategy which has contributed to anundervalued stock price may also result in a strong takeoverdefense. They said UAL paid a lot for some of its assets andthat in itself may make the company undesireable.    "I think they have a fairly tough management that will atleast be able to do battle with a potential shark and may wellbe able to defeat them. These guys aren't pushovers," saidSteve Lewins, an airline analyst at Citicorp.    Lewins believes the company could ultimately boost thestock price to a level that would reflect its assets, but itwill take time and improvements in earnings.    "If they put their nose to the grindstone, we're talkingabout years for anyone (in the airline industry)," he said."The whole unwinding of the battle of Texas Air is going totake years, establishing the Pacific in competition with (NWAInc NWA>) Northwest is going to take until 1990," Lewins said.     UAL today rose 2 1/2 to 62 1/2 on heavy volume of 1.9 mlnshares.

The industry trade association called on U.S. securitiesfirms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets toguard against illegal trading by employees.    The association also backed broad federal restrictions on avariety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers.    But it said investment banking firms should be allowed tocontinue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisitionactivities so long as those functions were kept separate.    The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board ofdirectors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federalSecurities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stockexchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages.    The report said securities firms "should be more rigorous inrestricting sensitive information on a need to know basis."    It said firms should train their employees to understandthe need for confidentiality of market sensitive information.    It said legislation to define insider trading should avoidexpanding current law in a way that would impede the market.    It said an insider trading definition should exempt asecurities firm from liability for law violations by itsemployees unless the firm had participated in or was aware ofthe wrongdoing.    In the mergers and acquisitions area, the associationadvocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeoverprotection plans without prior shareholder approval.    It said a group or individual buying up a company's stockshould be required to file a public disclosure statement beforeacquiring more than five pct of the company's shares. Undercurrent law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days afterexceeding the five pct limit.    The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of acompany's voting stock shouls be made only through a tenderoffer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is nolimit on open market purchases.    The group said the federal government should preempt stateregulation of defensive takeover tactics.    The group said all tender offers should remain open for atleast 30 calendar days.    The current requirement is expressed in business days.    It said so called "lockup" devices, in which securities areissued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fendoff an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of thetarget company's total common stock.    Association president Edward O'Brien said the group actedout of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporateAmerica on Wall Street and investor fears about insider tradingand fairness in the marketplace.

The auditor's point out, as Texaco has in the past, thecompany's loss of any of several pending court decisions inthis case could cause it "to face prospects such as having toseek protection of its assets and business pursuant to thebankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11" of thefederal bankruptcy code.    Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reducedPennzoil's judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs,Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by theappeals court no later than March 30.    Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the companyand its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrelsat the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier.    However, inclusion of Texaco's equity in the EasternHemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited thedecline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of1985.    Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiariesdeclined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 andupward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mlnbarrels from 117 mln, respectively.    Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the UnitedStates   where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from1.55 billion.    The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, withabout 44 pct of the decline   some 24,000 barrels per day  representing high cost production shut in or curtailed inresponse to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986.

LOUIS, Mo., March 25   </DATELINE><BODY>Southwestern Bell Corp said thatits planned acquisitions of cellular telephone and pagingsystems, including those of Metromedia Inc>, will result insome initial earnings dilution and an increase in debt ratio.    In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, theregional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earningsdilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in itsdebt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt levelwithin an acceptable range.    In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Belllisted a debt to equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from43.7 pct in 1985.    In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a sharein 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billiondlrs.    Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have anegative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss ofinvestment tax credits.    By mid year, however, the company said a reduced corporatetax rate should have a positive impact on its net income andcash flow.

Speaking to reporters at the annual meeting of the Inter American Development Bank, Nogales said Bolivia's bank advisorycommittee, led by Bank of America, is seeking permission fromcreditor banks worldwide to go ahead with the scheme.    More than 50 pct of the banks must approve, and Nogalessaid he is confident this threshold will be reached.    "It's working out very well, and I think we'll get a clearmajority," Nogales said.    A senior banker working on the deal also said that banksare responding positively and said all the legal waiversnecessary could be obtained within two months.    Bolivia halted all payments on its commercial bank debt inMarch 1984. Hyperinfltion has been curbed and public spendingtrimmed, but the country's debt still trades as low as 10 ctson the dollar on the secondary market, and many banks havewritten off most, if not all, of their loans to the country.    Few bankers see little chance for a subtantive recovery inBolivia's economic fortunes and so are willing to collect whatthey can on the loans.    Nogales said Bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at amarket price. He said some banks might want to hold out for ahigher price, but others would see the repurchase offer as anopportunity to cut their losses.    Bolivia intends to pay for the repurchase with aid thatforeign goernments, especially the United States and WestGermany, are providing to help finance the eradication of cocacrops. Cocaine, although illegal, is Bolivia's largest export.    The campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal cropsinstead of coca would be financed instead using local currency,Nogales said.    Because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some fourpct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increasedto pay for the drug eradication drive without too much of nimpact on inflation, he added.    Nogales said he does not expect Bolivia's debt repurchaseto become a model for other debtors in dire straits. "We're notseeking a universal solution," he said."

"It's a bad idea. We don't need more money to balance thebudget. We need to reduce spending and avoid things that wouldhalt economic expansion," Miller told students at theUniversity of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.    "I think economic growth could be threatened mightily if wehave a tax increase or by the perception that we're giving upon deficit reduction," he said.    Miller criticised a proposal by House speaker Jim Wright toput a one pct tax on securities transactions.    He said the tax would probably be ineffective becausepeople would avoid by holding their portfolios in otherinstruments, like real estate, or simply by not trading asoften.    Miller said he doubted this proposal would pass.    "I think it is frankly all but political suicide toadvocate a tax increase unless the president championed it aswell," he said. "And he's not going to do it, in fact he wouldveto a tax increase," Miller added.

"We could see the trade deficit start down in February orMarch," Baldrige said in an appearance before the SenateGovernmental Affairs Committee.    He predicted the trade deficit, which was 170 billion dlrsin 1986, would decline by 30 to 40 billion dlrs in 1987 and in1988.    Baldrige said he was making his prediction without havingseen the February trade figures, but he said that the volume ofimports has dropped beginning with the fourth quarter of 1986and will continue to drop in this quarter.    The eventual turnaround in the monthly trade figures willreflect the impact of the decline in the dollar, Baldrige said.

"I don't know who in Congress would propose that happening.Politically it would be totally unacceptable," an aide to asenior farm state senator said.    USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week thatCongress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel ratherthan increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.    "I'm convinced that Congress will not go along with this,"American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said.    Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that ifthe soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then considerways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive.    His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  theadministration's position is in the debate over what should bedone to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protectsoybean farmers' income.    Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown theloan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have beenpointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean pricescompetitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues tomaintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a movewould be too costly.    "There will be alot of other options that will beconsidered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutzproposal," said Bill O'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan(R Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee.    "Anybody representing large groups of soybean producerswould not be very excited about supporting a lower soybeanloan," O'Conner said.    Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan anddecide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlrbasic rate, but that there has to be something mandated toincrease soybean's competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen.Thad Cochran (R Miss) said. Cochran, a staunch supporter of asoybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, Graves said.

Speaking to reporters at the annual meeting of theInter American Development Bank (IADB) here, Nogales saidBolivia's bank advisory committee, led by Bank of America, isseeking permission from creditor banks worldwide to go aheadwith the scheme. More than 50 pct of the banks must give theirapproval, and Nogales said he is confident that this thresholdwill be reached.    "It's working out very well, and I think we'll get clearmajority," Nogales said.    A senior banker working on the deal also said that banksare responding positively and said all the legal waiversnecessary could be obtained within two months.    Bolivia halted all payments on its commercial bank debt inMarch 1984. Hyperinflation has been curbed and public spendingtrimmed, but its debt is still trading as low as 10 cts on thedollar on the secondary market and many banks have written offmost, if not all, of their loans to the country.    Bankers see little chance for a substantive recovery inBolivia's economic fortunes and so are willing to collect whatthey can on the loans.    Nogales said Bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at amarket price. He said some banks might want to hold out for ahigher price, but others would see the repurchase offer as awindow of opportunity to cut their losses.    Bolivia intends to pay for the repurchase with aid thatforeign governments, especially the United States and WestGermany, are providing to help finance the eradication of cocacrops. Cocaine, although illegal, is Bolivia's largest export.    The campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal cropsinstead of coca would be financed instead using local currency,Nogales said.    Because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some fourpct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increasedto pay for the drug eradication drive without too much of nimpact on inflation, he added.    Nogales said he did not expect Bolivia's debt repurchase tobecome a model for other debtors in dire straits. "We're notseeking a universal solution," he said."

ICN also said the planned sale will have no effect on itslong term research partnership with Kodak and Kodak's continuedfunding of the Nucleic Acid Research Institute.    Two years ago Kodak agreed to invest 45 mln dlrs over sixyears to form and operate a venture with ICN to explore newbiomedical compounds. It acquired a 2.3 pct stake in ICN as aresult of that agreement.    ICN said Kodak today confirmed to ICN its continuingconfidence in the progress of the joint project.

Standard and Poor's said its downgrade of Chemical alsoreflected that holding company's acquisition of Texas CommerceBancshares TCB>, which was just now approved by the FederalReserve.    For Mellon and Security Pacific, S and P cited highernon performing assets and weaker operating earnings.    The rating agency said it completed a review, based on 1986results, of the largest U.S. bank holding companies. It paidspecial attention to reassessing the effect of exposures tolesser developed countries on the holding companies' earningsand capital.    "Brazil's unilateral moratorium on debt service paymentsunderscored the potential for polarization between bankers anddebtor countries," S and P said.    S and P noted that while Argentina, Brazil, Mexico andVenezuela each face unique economic problems, the lack ofprogress toward moderating their debt service burdens has beendisappointing.    However, the agency pointed out that a substantiveimprovement in the large banks' financial positions has actedas a counter balance to the Latin American debt situation.    Citing increasing financial strength, S and P said itaffirmed the debt ratings of Citicorp CCI>, Bankers Trust NewYork Corp BT>, Bank of Boston Corp BKB> and J.P. Morgan andCo Inc JPM>.    S and P noted that most U.S. bank holding companies havewhat it termed easily realizable capital resources available tothem, such as undervalued real estate, appreciated portfoliosecurities and overfunded pension plans.    "Most bank managements appear committed to improving thequality of their balance sheets," S and P said, noting many nowemphasize long term strategies over short term earnings.    Standard and Poor's reduced Chase Manhattan's senior debtto AA minus from AA, subordinated debt to A plus from AA minusand preferred stock to A from A plus. The commercial paper ofthe parent and its unit Chase Manhattan Bank of Canada wereaffirmed at A 1 plus.    Chase has 3.2 billion dlrs of debt outstanding. It has 6.4billion dlrs of loans to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico andVenezuela   one of the highest exposures to lesser developedcountries among U.S. money centers.    Chase's underlying profitability remains at median levelsbecause of its high expense structure, S and P said.    S and P cut Chemical's and the unit Chemical New YorkN.V.'s senior debt to AA minus from AA and subordinated debt toA plus from AA minus.    About 1.2 billion dlrs of long term debt was affected.    The agency cited Chemical's relatively large exposure toLatin American borrowers, particulary Brazil and Mexico,continued high levels of nonperforming assets and the pendingacquisition of Texas Commerce.    Aggregate exposure to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico andVenezuela was almost four billion dlrs at year end 1986, or 105pct of equity and reserves, S and P pointed out.    Irving's senior debt was reduced to A plus from AA minus,with subordinated debt and preferred stock lowered to A fromA plus. Its commercial paper was affirmed at A 111 1plus.    Irving has about 500 mln dlrs of debt outstanding. Itsapproximately 1.4 billion dlrs of loans to the four major Latindebtor countries account for 110 pct of year end equity andreserves.    S and P downgraded Manufacturers Hanover's senior debt to Afrom A plus, subordinated debt to A minus from A and preferredstock to BBB plus from A minus but affirmed its A 1 commercialpaper. The bank has 3.8 billion dlrs of debt.    S and P noted that Manufacturers has about 6.7 billion dlrsof loans to the major Latin debtor nations and has experiencedweak earnings.    However, the unit CIT Group Holdings Inc's AA minus seniordebt and A 1 plus commercial paper were affirmed.    The rating agency cut Mellon's senior debt to A plus fromAA and preferred stock to A from AA minus. It has 1.1 billiondlrs of debt securities.    The commercial paper programs of Mellon Bank Canada andMellon Australia Ltd, guaranteed by the parent company, werelowered to A 1 from A 1 plus.

In a filing with the ICC late today, the company outlinedfour conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific.    Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into anagreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilitesof Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date, and thatthe financial condition of Southern remain largely unchangedfrom today onward.    "We are willing, even eager, to make a fair market valueoffer in cash for the Southern Pacific," said Kansas CitySouthern president and chief executive officer Landon H.Rowland.    "This offer disproves the constant derogation of theSourthern Pacific by SFSP management, best exemplified by SFSPChief Executive John Schmidt's comment in ICC hearings that theSouthern Pacific was 'bankrupt,'" said Rowland.    He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achievethe benefits of an end to end merger while preseving theindependece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing primecompetitor, Santa Fe.    Kansas said that Southern's management had estimated thevalue of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to1.2 billion dlrs.    It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon BrothersInc, hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in theirmerger, appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and800 mln dlrs less than Southern's own internal valuations.    Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer forSouthern after its books, records and properties are examined.    "Once that examination has been completed (and even in theabsence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate) KCSI will make anoffer in writing...." said the company.    Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fehad not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission'sreconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and SouthernPacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel eachother throughout their routes.    ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger asinherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioningfor reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreementswith the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western andother railroads, adds to the value of the merger.

"We might be able to see some additional value if we couldmeet" and get more financial data, said Joel Reed, speaking forthe investor group.    Reed told Reuters that GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds"was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at thistime." Cyril Wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephoneconversation with Reynolds, Reed said.    Wagner and Brown, along with AFG Industries Inc AFG>,recently launched a surprise tender offer for GenCorp. Theoffer is worth 2.23 billion dlrs.    Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per sharetender offer, which expires April 15, is a fair offer. GenCorpgained 3 1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE.    Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event hisgroup wins control. He said aerospace, soft drink bottling andentertainment units are potential divestiture candidates. Hesaid the tire business, which the group wants to keep, may bemore viable if merged with another tire company.    "One option would be to try to grow the tire businessthrough combination or an acquisition," Reed said. He said hebelieves such a merger could create a stronger force in thetire industry.    Gary Miller, chief financial officer of AFG, said hiscompany has a record of acquiring mature businesses andboosting productivity. Automation and incentives tied to profitsharing have been used with success, he said.    In the case of GenCorp's RKO General broadcasting stations,Reed said the plan of the partners is to step into GenCorp'sshoes and proceed with plans to  sell the stations.    The partners said if they succed in acquiring GenCorp theyintend to consummate sale of WOR TV in New York to MCA IncMCA>. GenCorp last year entered into an agreement to sell thestation for 387 mln dlrs.    The partners also said if they acquire Gencorp they wouldalso proceed with the proposed sale of KHJ TV in Los Angeles toWalt Disney Co DIS>. RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrsand Fidelilty Television, which challenged the license, wouldget about 103 mln dlrs.    The partners also said the Federal CommunicationsCommission established an expedited schedule for receivingcomments on their request for special temporary authorizationof proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formalapplication for transfer of the broadcast unit.    Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedulebecause it provides time for the agency to act on the requestbefore the expiration of the tender offer.    He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quicklyas possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations.    Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced bysome municipal officials in Akron, Ohio, where GenCorp isheadquartered, Reed said, "the plan of the partners offers longterm growth for Ohio."    He noted that the aerospace business, slated fordivestiture under the partners' plan, is located in California."Our program is one that overall would provide the greatestlong term growth for all segments," he said.

Talk among futures traders that cattle had died from thecold and blowing snow accounted for some of the strength inLive Cattle futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange today.    "Death (of cattle) can be directly attributed to the storm,but it's hard to get a handle on a number," Todd Domer,director of communications for the Kansas Livestock Associationsaid.    Domer noted that limited reports have been filtering in ofdeath losses at feedyards and from grazing and cow/calfoperations. Western Kansas was hardest hit while Eastern Kansasonly had rain, he said.    Paul Johnston of the Nebraska Livestock Feeders Associationsaid, "There's no question that baby calves coming in that kindof blizzard are probably not going to make it."    We were having such a nice winter and the cows were outcalving before the storm hit, he added.    The worst part of the storm came through the center of thestate. Precipitation was generally in the form of wet snow andsome feedlots are already like "soup", he said, inhibitingcattle movements.    The storm also had an effect on weight gain of largeranimals. Drifting snow caused problems in moving feed and mudmade it hard for cattle to reach the feed once it wasavailable.    Domer noted that feedyards sources say a tremendous cutbackhas occurred in feed consumption by cattle in the yards, whichmay or may not lead to sickness over the next several days.Cattle reduced daily feed consumption to about 12 lbs from 25during the worst of the blizzard, he said.    Mud will be more a problem as the weather breaks and snowmelts. Mud adds to stress on full grown animals and endangerssmaller ones which can fall and be trampled in pens. The costof feeding rises as animals generally consume more in coldweather, Domer said.    Domer said it will be at least 10 days before yards getback to normal.    Roy Gallant, from Accu Weather Services, said that althoughthe worst of the storm is over, there are still some stronggusty winds which will not diminish until tonight.    The storm started late Sunday night in West Kansas and isjust now winding down. The storm has moved into South Dakota,parts of Minnesota and Eastern North Dakota, he said.

Farm credit sources said Brent Beesley, president of theFarm Credit Corporation which represents the system, will makethe request at a Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearing.    They said Beesley would ask Congress to take some action toassure borrowers the stock is secure. But Beesley is expectedto stop short of requesting other forms of government aid.    Borrowers from the farm credit system hold some fourbillion dlrs in system stock which could be devalued if themounting losses of the system persist, officials said.    Beesley's request expected tomorrow is seen as the firstofficial acknowledgment from the system itself that federal aidwill be needed to guarantee the value of the stock.    Yesterday, Jim Billington, a member of the Farm CreditAdministration board which regulates the system, said Congressshould plan to spend at least 800 mln dlrs beginning late thisyear to bail out the system.    Congress is moving swiftly toward legislation to aid thesystem. Sen. James McClure, R Idaho, has drafted a resolutionwhich would put the Senate on record as guaranteeing the valueof farm credit system stock. The resolution may be brought tothe Senate floor soon, Congressional sources said.    In addition to requesting a guarantee of borrower stock,Beesley is expected tomorrow to endorse the creation of asecondary market, called "Aggie mae" by some proponents, forthe resale of farm real estate loans.    Sources said the farm credit system will support the ideaif the system is included in the operation of the market.    Farm credit sources said the system decided to request aguarantee of borrower stock at a meeting this week in Denver ofthe 12 presidents of farm credit system districts.    Beesley's testimony to the Congressional hearing tomorrowwill not include any new financial forecast of system losses,officials said.    Chairman of the FCA, Frank Naylor, yesterday said thesystem may lose as much as 1.4 billion dlrs this year.

Lomac will pay 17 mln dlrs to help clean the site, theysaid.    Stewart Freeman, Michigan's chief environmental attorney,told Reuters that Lomac, a new company, agreed to buy achemical site near Muskegon, Mich., formerly operated by BaforsNobel Inc, a bankrupt subsidiary of A.B. Nobel of Sweden.    The settlement was also the largest in history in abankruptcy case involving environmental issues, Freeman said.    Other companies with Superfund disputes are watching thecase closely, he said. "There are a number of very largecorporations talking to the attorney general," Freeman said,referring to Michigan Atty. Gen. Frank J. Kelley.    Freeman would not identify the companies involved, sayinghe was not sure whether confidentiality agreements had beenmade.    Lomac will pay 25 26 mln dlrs in the settlement. Five mlndlrs will be paid to the federal and 12 mln dlrs will go to theMichigan government for cleanup at the site, the LakewayChemical plant.    The remaining funds will go to medical surveillance offormer workers at the plant.    Under the agreement, a trust fund will be set up "tomonitor the health of employees who may have been exposed todangerous chemicals that were manufactured at the plant before1971," the Michigan attorney general's office said in astatement.    Freeman said the medical fund was necessary because ofpossible medical problems among workers at the site.    The Muskegon facility was formerly used to manufacturedyes. Freeman said Bofors Nobel spent 50 mln dlrs cleaning upthe site, formerly owned by Lakeway Chemical Co, before "theeconomic decision was made in Sweden" to place the operation inbankruptcy.    Under the agreement, Bofors Nobel will sell the site, whichstill holds an operating chemical plant, to Lomac. Some 150employees work at the plant, a spokesman for the Michiganattorney general said.    The state attorney general said cleanup at the site willbegin "immediately," and will be supervised by federal andstate officials.    Freeman said the plant site is not presently listed on thefederal superfund list, which qualifies the toxic waste sitefor federal cleanup funds.    He said federal officials will try to get the Muskegonfacility onto the superfund list. If they are unable to do so,the 5.0 mln dlr federal portion of the settlement will beturned over to Michigan officials to be used in the cleanup,Freeman said.

The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week thatpayment in kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who askednot to be identified said.    USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, sayingit did not take into account storage, handling and transportsavings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided tore examine the costs, sources said.    The issue is an important one, because congressional budgetcommittees are known to be considering limiting the use ofcertificates as a means of cutting spending.    Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO SeniorAssociate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before theSenate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.    Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there areuncertainties in determining the cost of certificates comparedto cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp,CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.    USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 centsto store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put ingovernment storage.    It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigativearm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs thegovernment more to use certificates instead of cash in farmprice and income support programs, Reagan administrationsources said.    The GAO is expected to point out that use ofpayment in kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tightstorage by moving grain that otherwise might not have beensold.    The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate DirectorBrian Crowley comes as congressional budget committeesintensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federalbudget deficit   including considering limits on the use ofPIK certificates.    The CCC issues dollar denominated PIK certificates, orcerts, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays tofarmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used torepay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities orcash.    Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billiondlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January andAugust 1987, according to USDA.    Certs can cost the government more than cash primarilybecause recipients can use the certificates to pay backgovernment loans at levels below the loan rate.    Eliminating this practice, called "PIK and roll," would savethe government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988 92, according tothe Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, accordingto a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificatescost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.    The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to beconsidering curbs on PIK and roll transactions among othersavings alternatives.    The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that theestimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to datehave cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mlndlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, oneadministration official said.    However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimatesbased in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.    The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributableto the different effect certificates can have on market pricesover the course of a crop year.    USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has foundthat between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels ofcorn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn bybetween 35 and 45 cents per bushel.    Between September and November, however, certificates hadonly a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERSstudy, obtained by Reuters.

Cavaco Silva, speaking on national television hours beforethe initialling in Peking of an agreement on the handover, saidthat under the accord Macao would be a special administrativeregion of China and would have a large measure of autonomy.    Under the accord, Portuguese administration of theterritory would end on December 20, 1999 but the existingsystem there would be maintained until the year 2050, CavacoSilva said.    "The existing way of life in Macao, the Portuguese laws,basically our political, economic and social system, willremain in force for a further 63 years from now," he said.    Cavaco Silva said he would go to Peking in the first halfof next month to formally sign the agreement with China, whichwould then be submitted to Portugal's parliament for approval.    Cavaco Silva said that after Portuguese administration ofMacao formally ended in 1999, the future government of theterritory would enjoy complete autonomy except in the areas ofdefence and foreign relations. It would however be able to makeeconomic, trade and finance agreements with other countries.    The head of government would be named on the basis ofelections held for the post.    Macao would have an elected legislative assembly and anindependent judiciary. There would be religious freedom, a freepress and freedom of expression. The Portuguese language couldcontinue to be used in the government, assembly and courts.    Cavaco Silva said the current financial system wouldcontinue after the year 2000. The existing banks and freedom ofcapital movements would be maintained as would theconvertibility of the pataca as the territory's monetary unitand the legal protection of foreign investment.    Only the Macao government would be able to collect taxes.    Cavaco Silva said that those among Macao's 400,000population who held Portuguese nationality on the date of thehandover would thereafter continue to be able to use theirPortuguese passports and their nationality rights.    The nationality issue had been one of the points ofdisagreement in the complex handover talks.    The special administrative status to be granted to Macaoafter its handover mirrors a similar accord for the nearbyBritish colony of Hong Kong, which reverts back to Chinese rulein 1997 under a 1984 Sino British agreement.

The success of the program, launched late last year, meantthe government would be able to go beyond the 30 billion francfigure it estimated in its 1987 budget, he said in a televisioninterview.    About 75 pct of the additional revenue would be used to cutstate debt and 25 pct to provide additional funds for publicsector investment, he said.    Chirac said Finance Minister Edouard Balladur proposed tomake two billion francs of supplementary funding available fora five biillion franc accelerated motorway building program.    The remaining three billion francs for this would come froma motorway loan now in the domestic market.    Balladur also proposed to make some extra cash available tothe French national railways, SNCF, for the construction ofhigh speed rail track, and to boost research in the aerospaceindustry, he added.    An estimated 15,000 jobs would be generated by speeding upmotorway construction, Chirac said.    Reaffirming his long term strategy of cutting the statesector deficit and easing taxes, Chirac repeated governmentpledges to cut the corporate tax rate to 42 pct from 45 pct inthe 1988 budget.    Personal income tax would also be reduced but details hadstill to be worked out, he added.

The three day meeting was dominated by the dispute and bythe failure of Brazil and its creditor banks to make anybreakthrough on debt talks after Brasilia suspended interestpayments last month.    Brazil's Central Bank governor Francisco Gros said aftertalks with its 14 bank advisory committee here yesterday thatit could not make a token interest payment now, as sought bybanks, but would maintain contact with the banks.    Delegates agreed to shelve discussion of IADB reforms untilthe half yearly International Monetary Fund and World Bankmeetings in two weeks time in Washington at which a decisionwill be urgently sought in order to maintain credit flows tothe recession hit region.    "The Bank cannot maintain an adequate lending level unlessit is given increased resources," IADB president Antonio OrtizMena told a press conference.    Ortiz Mena said 42 countries opposed Washington's proposalto lower veto power over loans to 35 pct of the Bank's votingshares from a simple majority as at present.    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said Monday the UnitedStates, as 34.5 pct shareholder and provider of the bulk of theBank's resources, should have more say in approving loans andconditioned a nine billion dlr increase in its contribution onapproving the reforms.    But Ortiz Mena said Latin America and the non regionalmembers including Europe and Japan had all supported a 40 pctveto level. Canada declined to state a position.    Behind the dispute was a U.S. attempt to radically changethe direction of the Bank, which has lent 35 billion dlrs toLatin America in its 28 years, and give it a bigger role in thecurrent debt strategy with increased lending but more stringentconditions attached.    But Ortiz said the Bank cannot divert too much of itsresources to so called sectoral lending, whereby loans tospecific sectors are tied to economic reforms, because thiscould affect the Bank's Triple A rating as a borrower in worldmarkets.    "For this reason we have agreed to limit sectoral loans to25 pct of the total, leaving the rest for investment inprojects," he said.    Ortiz Mena earlier told the Bank's closing session that asa result of negotiations here, the Bank can expect a newinjection of about 25 billion dlrs for the period 1987 90.    The United States has said it will only be able to supporta level close to the sixth replenishment of funds, which cameto 15.7 billion dlrs, unless its proposals are accepted.    But despite the impasse, some Latin American delegatesincluding Mexican Finance Minister Gustavo Petricioli said theywere optimistic a compromise agreement could be reached nextmonth.

But Machinea said the talks were difficult and Argentinawanted to conclude them as soon as possible.

"For a company that's supposed to be under siege, we aredoing extremely well. We are exceedingly profitable," aspokesman for the firm told Reuters.    The rumors that have swirled around Drexel, more than anyother broker, have involved concerns that its business will bethreatened by the Federal probe, say Wall Street sources. Thefirm has long been at the leading edge of the mergers businessand had ties to now disgraced speculator Ivan Boesky.    In the latest chapter of the story, Drexel said that somecommodities firms have begun to limit the amount of businessthey will do with the firm, citing credit risks. Drexel haslong been a powerful competitor in precious metals markets.    But Drexel spokesman Steve Anredder told Reuters thatDrexel's overall business is proceeding normally and thefirst quarter profit "could be the strongest of anybody on WallStreet."    "I wouldn't say we're not feeling any effect (from thetrading probes)," he said. "But we're doing extremely well."    The firm was among the first to be subpoenaed in thegovernment's wide ranging probe of illegal trading involvingthe use of confidential company information on Wall Street.    Believed to be under particular scrutiny was Drexel's "junkbond" operation   the issuance of high risk speculative debtthat it pioneered for financing corporate takeovers.    "We have done nothing wrong," said the Drexel spokesman."After a thorough investigation, we have found no evidence ofany wrongdoing by the firm or anyone within the firm."    The spokesman said that in the aftermath of the Boeskyarrest, Drexel had not been charged. Nor had any individual atthe firm been charged with illegal acts while employed byDrexel. One of its top merger specialists, Martin Siegel, wascharged in connection with a former job.    Still, more than any other firm on Wall Street, Drexel hassuffered the consequences of the insider trading probe. Tobegin with, there have been a series of brief shocks in thejunk bond market, in nervousness linked to rumors that Drexelmight be in trouble.    At one point, Drexel said Wednesday, a large Midwest bankrefused to allow Drexel issued bonds as collateral on creditlines. Two weeks ago, the restriction was withdrawn, it said.    The company also was notified last month that the outsideinsurer of Drexel's individual brokerage accounts had decidednot to renew coverage. Drexel has set up its own subsidiaryhandling part of the insurance. American International Groupand a group of British underwriters have handled the rest.    Drexel also appears to have lost ground to others in themergers and acquisition business recently, market sources said.However, Anredder said that there was no sign that Drexel hadlost any customers at all owing to the insider trading cases.But in citing results for the quarter, the company pointsmostly to other areas of success.    Corporate financings have totaled 8 billion dlrs, including3 billion dlrs in new junk bonds in the January March period,Drexel said. Drexel maintains the lion's share of thislucrative business, trade sources noted.    The market for junk bonds, although jittery, "has ralliedback with a vengeance," Anredder said.    Although they see new competition in the junk bond arena,market sources concur that Drexel remains king of the hill.    While some of the leading Wall Street firms were limitinghead to head dealings with Drexel in the commodity markets based on worries over the credit of the company, the Drexelspokesman called this "ridiculous."

On another topic, Britain called for a redefinition of therole of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.    "I think we should return to the original purpose of FDICinsurance   to protect small despositors and not depositoryinstitutions themselves," Brittain said.    He suggested banks be permitted to offer both insureddeposits and uninsured deposits. High quality assets would besegregated to back up insured deposits.

Thomas E. Mulligan, president of the board of directors,said 87 pct of the 61 members voting favored dissolution.    The directors recommended the move, citing falling volumeand higher costs, when it called a special shareholders meetinglast month.    Mulligan said the cooperative would continue operatinguntil April 24, when the member cooperatives will have to beginclearing their futures trades through other companies.    Mulligan said one of the members, Farmers Commodities ofDes Moines, Iowa, was attempting to organize a new cooperativeto replace Illinois Coop as a clearing company.    Sources close to Farmers Commodities confirmed its plans,but Hal Richards, president, could not be reached immediatelyfor comment, and it was unknown how many cooperatives might bewilling to band together.    Industry sources said Farmers Commodities would face adifficult task in setting up a new clearing organization byApril 24, the day Illinois Cooperative will be dissolved.    They would have to obtain commitments from a sufficientnumber of cooperatives to meet minimum capital requirements,obtain trading memberships, and set up the office mechanisms tohandle futures trading.    In the meantime, commercial clearing firms have beencourting the individual coops, trying to obtain their businesswith low trading rates.    If Farmers Commodities is unable to set up a clearingorganization by April 24, individual members will find otherhomes, and they're unlikely to change clearing firms a secondtime, one industry source said.    The demise of Illinois Coop was set in motion by thewithdrawl of Growmark, Inc., the largest member with more than70 pct of the capital stock, according to sources within thecooperative.    Mulligan acknowledged prior to the vote that Growmark hadno need to belong to the cooperative since it became affiliatedlast year with Archer Daniels Midland.    But he said Illinois Cooperative would still have been ableto meet minimum capital requirements without Growmark.    The vote to dissolve the organization was met with "acertain amount of pang," he said. "But in the final analysis,the decision has to be economic, not emotional."

Zorinsky's replacement, Republican David Karnes, has saidhe would like a seat on the panel, and Senate Republican LeaderRobert Dole (R Kan.) is said to have thrown his support behindKarnes, who would add a Midwestern vote to the panel.    But Karnes' appointment to the committee would require atleast one Republican to step off the committee.    Aides to Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and PeteWilson (Calif.), whose spots on the panel were rumored to be injeopardy, said their bosses were categorically opposed to beingpushed off the committee.    Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D Vt.) told Reuters hehad rejected a suggestion that Democrats and Republicans eachadd one member to the committee.    Leahy said he would be "delighted" to have freshman Sen. JohnBreaux (D La.) join the committee. But Breaux's appointment wasbeing resisted by Midwestern Democrats, who feel southernstates are adequately represented on the committee.    An aide to Sen. James Exon (D Neb.) said the senator,supported by Midwestern Democrats, had not ruled out thepossibility of moving to the committee.    The inability of the two parties to settle the matter couldincrease the possibility that the Democratic majority would beleft untouched at 9 8.

"We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Parisotherwise we would not have been a party too it," he said.    Baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to"co operate to foster greater exchange rate stability aroundthose levels."    He refused to comment directly on the current yen/dollarrate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recentlytended "to draw unwarranted inferences from what I say."    Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend assaying he has no target for the U.S. currency, a statement thattriggered this week's renewed decline of the dollar.    "I think the Paris agreement represents evidence thatinternational economic policy co ordination is alive and well,"Baker said.    The Treasury Secretary stressed however it was veryimportant for the main surplus countries to grow as fast asthey could consistent with low inflation to resolve tradeimbalances.    He added that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volckerhas also "been very outspoken" in suggesting main tradingpartners grow as fast as they can.    Baker noted that the J curve, the delayed beneficial effectof a weakening of a currency on that country's trade balance,takes 12 to 18 months to work its way through to the tradedeficit and it is now 18 months since the Plaza agreement tolower the dollar's value.

He put 1986 revenue at 222.03 billion yuan, against abudgeted 214.17 billion, and up from 185.41 billion in 1985,and expenditure at 229.11 billion, against a budgeted 214.17billion and 182.59 billion in 1985.    Official figures show the record post 1949 budget deficitwas 17 billion yuan in 1979.    Wang said the 1986 deficit was due to excess capitalconstruction and administrative expenses and unjustified andextravagant investments outside the state plan.    He also blamed the inefficiency of firms whose productioncosts and losses rose. He said subsidising state firms' lossescost 32.25 billion yuan. The 1985 budget did not give aseparate figure for this.    He said the processing industry developed too fast and someprojects could not start operations because of power shortages,while too many non productive facilities were set up.    Wang said 1986 and 1985 investment in fixed assets rose15.3 pct and 41.8 pct respectively year on year and consumptionfunds rose 12.5 pct and 23.7 pct, outstripping the growth innational income.    Wang said revenues were affected by the steep fall in worldoil prices, the decline in the price of primary products, adrop in income from customs duties and the rising cost ofearning foreign exchange through exports.    Revenue also fell because the state raised the rate ofdepreciation for fixed assets of certain state firms, reducedtheir regulatory tax and made other tax cuts for firms.    Wang said 1986 tax receipts rose to 206.45 billion yuanfrom 201.82 billion in 1985, state treasury bond receipts to6.2 billion from 6.04 billion and receipts from foreign loansrose to 7.87 billion from 2.5 billion.    He said 1986 budgetary spending on capital constructionrose to 65.57 billion yuan from 56.97 billion in 1985, ontechnical renovation and new products to 12.62 billion from10.05 billion, aid to rural production and other farm expensesto 12.03 billion from 10.16 billion, culture, science,education and public health to 38 billion from 31.72 billionand defence to 20.13 billion from 19.15 billion.

He said Guyana took its problems in January to theCaribbean Group for Cooperation and Development, which includesgovernments and multilateral agencies, with a view to finding along term recovery plan.    Guyana's arrears to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)are now 70 mln dlrs and it would not be eligible for new loansin the near future, Greenidge told Reuters during theInter American Development Bank (IADB) annual meeting here. MORE    Greenidge also said a World Bank mission would visitGeorgetown this week to assess prospects for a rescue plan thatwould enable Guyana to revive its economy. But he said thegovernment does not expect to be able to reduce its arrearsthis year.    Arrears to the IMF and the World Bank are projected to riseto 100 mln dlrs by the end of 1987. About 90 mln dlrs of this,equivalent to nearly half Guyana's annual exports, would beowed to the IMF.    "Expecting us to pay arrears is like asking a dying man togive a pint of blood," Greenidge said.    But Greenidge said Guyana has taken steps to reduce itsfiscal deficit, which now amounts to 65 pct of GDP. It hasincreased taxes, reduced public expenditure and refinanced itsinternal debt.    He said the World Bank would meanwhile look at investmentrequirements for potential export earning projects such as goldmining, timber, oil and kaolin.    Because of its arrears, Guyana has been unable to draw downa 40 mln dlr World Bank loan for a bauxite industryrehabilitation project. Bauxite accounts for 90 mln dlrs ofexports, or 40 pct of the total.

He told Japanese business leaders the Bank of Japan willcontinue to take adequate measures, including marketintervention, to stabilize exchange rates if necessary, inclose cooperation with other major industrialized nations. Hesaid the current instability of exchange rates will not last.    Six major nations   Britain, Canada, France, Japan, theU.S. And West Germany   agreed in Paris last month to acttogether to hold currencies stable.    Sumita said the Bank of Japan will continue to pursueadequate and flexible monetary policies while watching economicand financial developments in and outside Japan.    He said the decision to cut the discount rate on February20 was a hard choice for the Bank because monetary conditionshad already been sufficiently eased.    To prevent a resurgence of inflation, the Bank will take avery cautious stance regarding developments stemming from easycredit conditions, he said.    He said the latest discount rate cut to 2.5 pct shouldstabilize exchange rates and expand domestic demand.    Commenting on the dollar's fall below 150 yen, Sumitareiterated he cannot find any specific reason for thecurrency's weakness.    The market undertook speculative dollar selling by reactingto overseas comments by monetary authorities and trade tension,he said.    Sumita repeated that the Japanese economy may graduallyrecover in the latter half of the 1987/88 fiscal year endingApril 1, 1988, provided exchange rates stabilize.

He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure toreach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade.    He said the EC wanted to stick to the four year scheduleagreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That includedagricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in thelengthy program to re negotiate the GATT.    Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATTround include reform of trade in merchandise and services.    De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two dayconference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand.    Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what theysaw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called forurgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter,also said it was important agreement on agricultural tradereform was reached as early as possible.    But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached afterlong and hard negotiations, and the EC did not want changes.    "We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached,and that was very clear   that the new round would be oneundertaking. It is a global negotiation with no two tracks, nofast track, no slow track. It has just one track, the track  and that's all," de Clercq said.    "If you start selecting priorities, your priority is not mypriority. We say that agriculture is urgent, but it's not theonly urgent thing," he said.    He said the Punte del Este agreement had taken eight monthsto prepare and eight days of negotiations.

Ansell regional director Chris Humphrey told a newsconference the cream, already used in a condom brand asadditional contraceptive protection, killed on contact thevirus causing AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).    The discovery meant sexually active people could have asecond level of protection against AIDS if a condom rupturedduring sex, Humphrey said. "This is the best availableprotection against AIDS next to abstinence," he said.    But David Pennington, the head of Australia's governmentsponsored AIDS taskforce, said the use of the cream provided aslight safeguard but was no great breakthrough.    Pennington said that in the event of a condom rupturingsemen was likely to travel beyond the cream's range.    Humphrey said the studies, commissioned by Ansell fromNelson Gantz of the University of Massachusetts and Fred Judsonof the University of Colorado, showed nonoxynol nine destroyedthe AIDS virus present in 100 pct of rupture tests.    But he said it was not known whether nonoxynol nine was aseffective in sexual situations.    He stressed it was neither a cure nor a vaccine for AIDS.    Humphrey said nonoxynol nine had been used for about 20years as a spermicidal cream without side effects.

Many remisiers (brokers' agents) and dealers criticised theexchange for not taking the opportunity to abolish or cuttransfer fees on remisiers moving to other firms.    One remisier said the transfer fees inhibit an efficientbroking system because they restrict brokers' movements.    But most remisiers welcomed the amendment to replace cashdeposits with bank guarantees for business transactions. Wherean extra deposit is needed, it can in future be either in cashor in securities approved by the exchange.    Other remisiers felt the new rule that they must report alltransactions involving 50,000 dlrs or more to the exchange wasunnecessary.    Another revision says broking firms are not allowed toimprove a buying and selling quote by more than one bid duringthe last five minutes of trading.

He told a press briefing Wednesday that Manila has droppeda two tier interest payment offer, which would have given banksa higher return if they took partial payment in new Philippineinvestment notes (PINs) instead of in cash.    "The PINs proposal has been laid aside.... The discussion isnow on pricing (of just the cash payments)," he said.    Foreign banking sources in Manila said on Tuesday that thePhilippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 7/8over the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) but Ongpin wouldnot discuss details of the pricing negotiations.    He also refused to speculate on when an overall agreementmight be reached. The talks have been going on for more thanthree weeks.    Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8over LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs   tradeable,dollar denominated, zero coupon notes that could potentiallyyield up to one point over LIBOR.    The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee atleast a 7/8 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still hadgrave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for otherlarge debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.    The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as aseparate option for those banks, which might want to fund theirown investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in thesecondary market, Ongpin said.    Under Manila's plan, the PINs would be redeemable at fullface value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investmentsat any time prior to their six year maturity date.    While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINsproposal, Ongpin said there was great interest on the part ofcertain investment banks which are already active in thesecondary market for sovereign debt.    Unlike current debt/equity schemes, Ongpin said, the PINswould include no government fees and would be free from"administrative hassles."

"We do not want to export a model," Garcia told a pressconference at the end of an official two day visit to Mexicoyesterday. He was referring to Peru's policy of limitingpayments on its 14 billion dlr debt to 10 pct of its exportearnings.    Peru's attitude contrasts with that of Mexico, whichfollowed a more conciliatory route and last week signed a 7.7billion dlr loan package with its creditor banks.    Since it decided to put a ceiling on debt payments, Peruhas been barred from International Monetary Fund lending.    Despite their different approaches to debt, Garcia andMexican President Miguel de la Madrid issued a jointdeclaration yesterday calling the foreign debt problem an"expression of the present unjust international economic order."But the declaration said that no Latin American debtors' clubwas about to appear.    "We affirm the sovereignty of our economic decisions and thecapacity for mobilising our own resources," it said.    The two presidents also signed a variety of agreementsaimed at boosting trade and tourism between their countries aswell a number of technical cooperation pacts.    Garcia was scheduled to return to Lima tomorrow.

But the government is slowly being forced to take a moreactive economic role, partly to face the challenge from fastgrowing economies like South Korea and Taiwan and economicpowerhouse Japan, businessmen said.    The government announced this month it will spend six mlnH.K. Dlrs over the next two years to encourage electronicsfirms to send engineers for training overseas.    The engineers will learn design of application specificintegrated circuits (ASIC) used in products ranging frompersonal computers to high technology toys that talk.    The government has funded vocational training before butthis will be its first such program aimed at bringing backadvanced technology from overseas.    Government officials told Reuters that other areas in theelectronics sector are being considered for similar treatment.    Hong Kong's key electronics industry last year accountedfor exports of 61 billion H.K. Dlrs, though the total includessales of electrical machinery and other items.    Officials said that this key sector, second only totextiles in terms of exports, needs high technologies alreadyavailable in neighbouring economies if it is to compete.    "Belatedly, we realize there are some technologies whichcan't be taught here," said K.Y. Yeung, Director of Industry.    A study by U.S. Research firm Dataquest Inc last yearshowed that Hong Kong's share of U.S. Consumer electronicimports had fallen to 3.5 pct in 1985 from 6.4 pct in 1983.    South Korea, Taiwan and Japan all take a more active rolein guiding economic development and policy makers are worriedthat perhaps some assistance   albeit limited   is needed.    "This is perceived to be an area of development for HongKong," said Lawrence Mills, director general of the Federationof Hong Kong Industries. "Many industrialists think governmentshould be more actively concerned with this area."    Hong Kong likes to call its policy "positivenon intervention," meaning that it helps industry mainly bymaintaining economic stability and ensuring that needed roadsand harbour facilities are in place.    It offers no special tax incentives for foreign investors,believing that its low corporate profits tax of 18 pct andpersonal income tax of 16.5 pct are sufficient.    But the government has been forced to gradually take a moreactive role in the economy. In the last three years it hasstepped in to aid seven problem banks, taking over three ofthem, to protect depositors whose funds were not insured.    It has also expanded the powers of its banking andsecurities commissions to police these key economic sectors.    Industry officials said manufacturers need help acquiringexpensive new technology, especially when returns on investmentare years away. "This is only a small start but it will helpmake this technology more readily available," said an engineerwith a major U.S. Electronics firm in Hong Kong.    Texas Instruments Inc TXN> and Motorola Inc MOT> of theU.S. And Japan's Toshiba Corp TSBA.T> already conduct ASICdesign work in Hong Kong, while a handful of firms havecommitted funds for capital intensive production.    Under the industry department program, companies would befunded to train engineers overseas but those employees would berequired to apply their new skills locally for an as yetunspecified period.    "We want to promote ASIC design and eventually production inHong Kong," said Yeung of the Industry Department.    Some industrialists said it will take more than a trainingprogram to keep electronics manufacturers competitive in theyears ahead. Government officials said most manufacturers inthe industry are small scale, employing fewer than 100 people.    These firms will not be able to afford expensive technologydevelopment programs, industry officials said.    The program has raised concerns that government may one dayveer too far from its policy of minimal intervention. "They'vereached the right decision," said Mills of the Federation ofIndustries. "But the fear (among some firms) is it might be aslippery slope towards interference."

The Japanese capital is shaken by hundreds of small tremorsevery year, but last week's biq quake in western Japan, whichmeasured 6.9 on the open ended Richter scale, was a timelyreminder that the big one could come at any time.    Another on Tuesday registering a preliminary 6.5 on thescale struck the Sea of Japan coast northwest of Tokyo.    A widely accepted theory by the late seismologist KawasumiHiroshi states that major quakes occur in cycles averaging 69years. Tokyo was last laid flat in 1923 by a tremor reading7.8, raising the spectre of another within five years.    Seismic experts at Shizuoka, one of three areas near Tokyoconsidered quake prone, say they expect a major earthquakewithin the next few years.    Added to such fears is the fact that no developed nationhas suffered a major quake since the far reaching changes inthe last two decades which have bound the global economy into acomplex, fragile, interdependent financial network.    "We are reaching a dangerous time. Insurance companies arestarting to worry about how to cover the large losses," saidHatsuho Narita, a manager at the British Insurance Group.    "It's a theme that has worried a lot of people. It'sdifficult to put a figure on it, but the impact on all worldmarkets would be considerable," Brian Waterhouse, a bankingexpert at brokerage James Capel in Tokyo, told Reuters.    What would happen?    Consider that Tokyo and its six surrounding prefecturesaccount for up to 40 pct of Japanese gross national product, orsome six pct of world GNP.    Some economists believe that in the immediate aftermath ofa Tokyo quake, the yen would rise against sterling because ofthe large amount of reinsurance which would fall due in London.But it would plunge against other currencies.    This would worsen the dramatic loss of value in land andassets in the Tokyo area. Banks would be left holding hundredsof billions of dollars in worthless mortgages and loans.    Bankers estimate that 50 to 70 pct of city and regionalbanks' loan exposure is to smaller business, which would mostlikely lose all in a quake. Up to nine pct of their exposure isin housing and consumer loans, they said.    Many smaller banks and some larger ones would go to thewall, bankers polled by Reuters said.    The government, aware that insurance claims would be huge,has set a payout ceiling of 10 mln yen per private house. InTokyo, 100 mln yen buys only a very modest residence.    In addition, the insurance industry has formed the JapanEarthquake Reinsurance Co to cover housing to a total of 10billion dlrs, 80 pct of it government guaranteed.    However, insurers said the industrial sector, which has nogovernment backing, is a more dangerous risk.    Japanese insurers said they are finding it increasinglydifficult to find reinsurance abroad.    "Overseas firms are now very alert to earthquake insurancerisks," said Tahashi Kumakiri, Foreign Department head at theJapan Non life Insurance Association.    Due to limited world insurance capacity, the FinanceMinistry recommends a coverage limit of 15 to 30 pct ofJapanese firms' total insurable value.    Even so, one insurer believes that local firms reinsure upto 80 pct of their quake cover overseas, most of it throughLloyds of London.    Some of this reinsurance is then reinsured again,compounding the risks should the money suddenly be called in.    Foreign entities in Japan are allowed 100 pct quake coverbut foreign insurers now set a limit of 60 pct.    Industrial cover is confidential but official figures showthat in fiscal 1985/86 ended March 31, Japan did about half abillion dlrs of overseas reinsurance business in fire cover,most of which is quake related.    Bankers said the destruction of underlying assets andrepatriation of huge amounts of Japanese overseas investmentwould seriously affect overseas stock and bond markets.    Japanese institutions buy a net 10 billion dlrs or so offoreign bonds a month, much of it U.S. Treasuries, and arepurchasing more and more U.S. And European stocks. The value offoreign holdings of Japanese securities would nosedive.    Japan would need huge amounts of money over a long periodto rebuild, which would block out developing nation creditorsfrom existing capital resources, the bankers said.    Loss of central computers would mean billions in losttransactions, bankers noted.    Oil traders said crude prices would plummet as imports fellby up to half from some three mln barrels per day now.

He told the National People's Congress, the State Councilhas decided to cut nearly all 1987 budgetary expenditures by 10pct from the 1986 level. He said expenditures for the past twoyears have been inflated.    Investment by localities in capital construction in 1987must fall by 50 pct from the 1986 level and state firms mustcut their losses by 30 pct, he said.    China will use 14.6 billion yuan in foreign loans in 1987,up from 7.87 billion in 1986, Wang said.    It must cut back on investment in capital construction,especially construction outside the state plan, he said. Fundsmust go into energy, transport, telecommunications, raw andsemi finished materials and not into non production sectors.    "In view of the country's financial difficulties this year,it has been decided that seven billion yuan of the budgetaryallocation for capital construction will be raised by thePeople's Bank through loans and the issuing of bonds," he said.    Wang said all localities and departments must strictlyconfine their 1987 capital investment to the amount set out inthe state budget, a 50 pct reduction from 1986 levels.    He said that because of financial difficulties, the statecannot increase spending on culture, education, science andpublic health in 1987 at the same rate as over the past fewyears. Expenditure in those sectors will rise by two pct.    The only allocations not to be affected by the general 10pct cutback are subsidies for price rises, repayment ofprincipal and interest on domestic and foreign loans, funds forthe disabled and spending for other social relief.    Wang said state firms must cut their total losses by 30 pctfrom the 1986 level, overhead expenses by 10 pct and rawmaterial consumption by two pct. Commercial firms must cuttheir deficits by 20 pct and running costs by two pct.    He said violations of financial and economic discipline arecommon, including tax evasion, false accounting, embezzlement,theft, extravagance and accepting and offering bribes. Suchpractices "have reached very serious proportions in some areas,departments and units" and must be dealt with seriously, hesaid.    Wang said 11.4 billion yuan worth of foreign loans havebeen arranged according to the 1986 90 plan, with 3.2 billiongoing to pay for foreign equipment in the Baoshan steel plantnear Shanghai.    He said China is running no risk in using more foreignloans, provided it prepares careful feasibility studies,borrows only what it can repay and uses the loans only todevelop production in priority sectors.    Wang said China plans to levy new taxes on the use ofarable land for non farm purposes starting this year. Half therevenue generated will go to the state and half to localitiesto be used in the development of agriculture.    The only new spending is 11 billion yuan to be used tocover tax reductions and increased subsidies for big andmedium size state firms and textile and other light industries.The money will also pay for increases in the state purchasingprices of some grain, cotton and oil yielding crops, he said.

The offer would be made through its BP North America Inc>unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. Theoffer would not be conditional on any minimum number of sharesbeing tendered.    BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was basedon its own valuation as well as those of its financialadvisers. It took into account reviews of both public andnon public information.    Standard closed in New York last night at 64 7/8 dlrs, down1 3/4 dlrs.    BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p atlast night's close.    About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP'sown resources.    The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly frombanks under a four year committed revolving credit facility andpartly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. Thecompany said it was in the course of arranging thesefacilities.    BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group'sinvestment in Standard was its largest single asset. Fullownership would enable investment and operating decisions to bemade without the limitations of a minority interest.    BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimumuse of its financial resources. It was confident oil priceswere likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify theinvestment.    Walters added that it also felt that, due to managementchanges in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully evenin a lower oil price environment.    Standard's net assets at end 1986 were 7.02 billion dlrsand in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs beforetax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.    Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.One noted that it was not immediately clear why the groupshould spend so much money buying a company it alreadycontrolled.    BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standardshares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.    It was also unclear what effect the tender would have onthe U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended todispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the1987/88 financial year, analysts said.    Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson notedthat any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP woulddepend on the reaction of the markets.    The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59pct from 20 pct currently, he said.    However, with the likelihood that oil prices would notrepeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standardreturning to profitability this year   and BP benefitting fromits cash flow   were good.    Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.    Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel tomake money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue fromproduction and its downstream activities would push itcomfortably into surplus.    BP initially took a stake in Standard following thediscovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP hadinadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crudeoil.    The analysts said that BP had promoted a major managementreorganisation of Standard in the past year.    The probability that much of the shake up at Standard wasnow complete was one possible factor behind the timing of thetender offer, Spedding said.    BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as majorbalance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been wellreceived in the markets.    The lower costs that should now be possible   especiallyafter the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division  should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to comestraight through to 1987 profits without being cut back byother sectors.

The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar andother currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressureon selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices ofcrude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale ofpolystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.    World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01billion from 42.72 billion.    Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billionmarks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.    The statement made no mention of net profit figures.Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.    In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by thecold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continuesat present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below theprevious year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from1986, Hoechst said.    Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and informationtechnology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.    Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance ofthe parent company, other units in West Germany, and toAmerican Hoechst Corp>.    Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected therestructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.    Roussel Uclaf RUCF.PA> and most domestic non consolidatedpartners did not perform as well as in 1985.    Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretaxprofits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earningsfrom interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall inextraordinary costs.    The fall in raw material prices was not enough tocompensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices andcurrencies, Hoechst said.    The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in newprojects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capitalincrease of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with theacquisition of Celanese Corp>.

This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in thefirst three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 311986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.    The analysts estimated that the group would report a thirdquarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.    BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amountedto 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.    The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn inpetroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflectingsome improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Straitfields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral andsteel earnings.    They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coalprices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has beenaffected by industrial and production problems.    The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP'slowest earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors,and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around300 mln dlrs.    One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be atax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance oncapital expenditure in the steel division, they said.    They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it wouldbe difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit.

The rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 Ecus short of thelevel producers thought necessary and that of the previous weekwas 2.5 Ecus below this level.    But the sources said producers who have offered a total of854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparentattempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximumrebates have given no formal indication to the Commission thatthey intend to withdraw these offers.    The French and German operators involved would be able towithdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when thesugar will officially enter intervention stores.    The five week period is the normal delay between sugargoing into intervention and payment being made for it.

The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added.    The Statistics Office had originally put the Januarycurrent account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.    The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billionmark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the currentaccount surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplusrecorded in February 1986.    A Statistics Office statement said the widening of theFebruary current account surplus compared with January was dueto seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current accountfigures are seasonally adjusted.    February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986but a rise of 5.5 pct against January.    Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pctcompared with January.    The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculatethe real change in exports and imports in February. But forcomparison purposes it noted that in January the average valueof imports had fallen 15 pct year on year while the averagevalue of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.    Within the current account, the services account had 300mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln marksurplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion markdeficit.    Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports invalue terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with ayear earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks,a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.    The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks forJanuary/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1billion marks in the year ago period.    The cumulative current account surplus for January andFebruary 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billionmarks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.    Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplusreflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well asseasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlierthis week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct againstJanuary while export prices were unchanged.    "The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trendthat is not expected to change for several months at least,"said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said thesurplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.    An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) inFrankfurt said a two month comparison of trade figures gave amore accurate picture of West Germany's trade position.    He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January andFebruary together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplusposted in November and December.    "The trend is clearly lower," he said.    This economist, who declined to be named, said the Februaryrise was also partly explained by special factors in January,when there had been a number of public holidays as well asextremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.

"Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meetingconsumers' demands and the cutback ... Is too marginal," aHousewives Association of Japan official said.    Despite mounting U.S. Pressure on Japan to open farmmarkets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, whichmaintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers.    Under the plan, expected to be announced this month, thestandard or bottom price of castrated wagyu   known as marbledbeef   will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820.    The standard price of other beef, mainly produced fromdairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceilingat 1,325 against 1,420.    Ministry officials said the semi government LivestockIndustry Promotion Corp (LIPC) conducts buffer stock operationsto help keep wholesale beef prices within the interventionprice zone.    The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amountset by the government under a quota system. When wholesaleprices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks,both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef whenprices are below.    But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beefstocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.    Phillip Seng, Asian Director of the U.S. Meat ExportFederation, told Reuters the two pct cut in prices is a steptoward closing the gap with European Community prices, abouthalf those in Japan.    But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U.S.Meat exporters because of Japan's rigid and complicateddistribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC.    The Housewives Association official said retail beef pricesare high mainly because of distribution problems and highproduction costs, as well as poor operations by the LIPC.    American meat packers see Japan as a promising market. F.C.Beatty, of U.S. Packer John Morrell and Co, told the JapanTimes beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound inthe U.S., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan.

But industry sources said it is unclear how much demandwill pick up if retail beef prices drop following any sharpreduction in intervention prices.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said this week hewill ask Japan to remove all beef import restrictions when hevisits here next month.    In 1984, Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by9,000 tonnes a year until March 31, 1988.    In 1987/88, the quota will rise to 177,000 tonnes from168,000 in 1986/87, ministry officials said, adding Japan wantsto keep self sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct.

But David SyCip, chief executive trustee of the AssetPrivatisation Trust (APT), told a meeting of financialexecutives the APT has not yet received a list of the firms.    "I believe lead investor groups, people who see long termpotential, are willing to buy such companies in full and do ahands on job of running them," SyCip said.    SyCip said open bidding would be used to sell all assetshandled by the APT. He said bidding would be eitheropen priced, if there were enough serious contenders, or theAPT would set a target price for acquisition. He added that thetarget price did not constitute a rigid floor.    "What we consider an acceptable price is a price at which aninvestor will earn an adequate return," he said.    SyCip said the bulk of the APT's current work relates tothe non performing assets of the state owned Development Bankof the Philippines (DBP) and the Philippine National Bank(PNB). The APT was set up in January.    SyCip said about 75 pct of the 400 odd assets that the DBPand the PNB are handing over to the APT are still in the formof financial assets.    "In some cases financial assets have been converted intophysical assets by foreclosures. They are fairly cut and driedbecause we are dealing with mostly whole production facilitieslike textile or food processing plants," he said.    "Financial assets are more complicated. The only recourse isto foreclose, gain titles, and try to sell the asset, but thelaws here tend to favour the debtors," he added.    SyCip said although the APT is protected from prosecutionby its charter, many debtors are tying up the panel withlitigation.    "If you see some of the situations we have to work our waythrough you will see that our symbol, a Gordian knot, is an aptillustration," he said.    SyCip said the PNB has not succeeded in foreclosing on 16of the 17 sugar factories it wants to sell because of the highcosts involved. "When you do your arithmetic you realise that ifyou did foreclose your recovery would be only a fraction of theasset's book exposure," he said.    SyCip said the APT was not worried about whether associatesof former President Ferdinand Marcos, who originally owned manyof the bankrupt companies, would buy them back through theprivatisation scheme.    "We just look at the bottom line, which is to monetise theseassets to the maximum degree possible," he said. "We are sellingfor cash, it is not our concern where it comes from."    He said he had told cabinet ministers sceptical about theidentities of buyers that "Marcos cronies" could easily put uplegitimate fronts if they were specifically barred from biddingfor assets on the block.    "I told them if I am paid 20 mln pesos in 100 peso bills,all with identical serial numbers and they look like genuinelegal currency, then I would accept them'," SyCip said.    He said some participants in the government's debt equityswap scheme were interested in buying non performing assetswith the pesos they receive from such deals. The problem isgovernment regulations slow down approval of debt equity plansand the APT normally demands full payment within 15 days.    "The Central Bank and Monetary Board could also look atinvestment funds earmarked for non performing asset purchases,"he said. "It would greatly facilitate matters."    SyCip said last month the APT hoped to recover about 24billion pesos of the assets' total worth of 108 billion.    President Corazon Aquino announced earlier this month thatproceeds from the sale of APT controlled assets would be usedto finance the government's land reform program, which aims todistribute about 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants.    Asked why the APT did not favour Filipino buyers, SyCipsaid: "How much money has the country to lose because of this'Filipinos first' slogan? How many people have becomemillionaires and then forgotten the Philippines and put theirmoney in the United States or Australia?"

Both steps are aimed at establishing a wider domesticcapital market as part of Singapore's plans to expand itsfinancial sector, Finance Minister Richard Hu said.    Banking sources said the new government securities market,scheduled to have been launched on March 2, had been delayedpending legislative approval of these bills.    The 35 billion dlrs maximum which may be raised under theDevelopment Loan Bill (1987), against a ceiling of 15 billionunder current laws, is expected to satisfy demand forgovernment securities over the next four years, Hu said.    He said 6.1 billion dlrs of the 15 billion has so far beenraised as development loans. The rest will be used up whenbonds are issued to absorb advance deposits of 13.9 billiondlrs from the Central Provident Fund (CPF), a mandatory pensionsavings scheme. Workers and employers contribute a respective25 pct and 10 pct of a worker's salary to the CPF, which hadfunds totalling 29.3 billion at end 1986.    Regular government securities issues are needed to meet thedemand of banks, insurance companies, other financialinstitutions and corporate and individual investors, Hu said.    The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) had said itplanned to launch trading by issuing taxable instrumentsgrossing seven billion dlrs in the first year and a gross 38billion dlrs of paper over the next five years.    Funds raised in excess of the government's budgetary needswill not be channelled into increased spending, but will berecycled back to the financial system, largely through the MAS,Hu said.    Hu said the current government securities market isrudimentary, with the CPF holding three quarters of theoutstanding debt and banks, discount houses and insurancecompanies holding the rest. "The concentration of securities inthe hands of such long term holders has left little scope fortrading activity," he said.    "Moreover, the maturity of the bonds, mostly 20 years, wasnot attractive to other investors who might have been expectedto deal more actively in the market. The infrequency of bondissues exacerbated the lack of liquidity necessary for thedevelopment of a market," Hu said.    Hu said these obstacles have been resolved and regularissues of government securities will be made, initiallycarrying terms of up to five years and market related yields.    The minimum denomination is 1,000 dlrs for notes and bonds  aimed at individual investors   and 10,000 dlrs for thetreasury bills, which are directed at corporate investors.    Eight primary and registered dealers have undertaken tomake markets in order to ensure liquidity, he said.    Hu said while the new government securities market will beessentially domestic, non residents are free to invest, butinterest earned will be subject to withholding tax.    Hu said under the new Treasury Bills (Amendment) Bill, allbook entries of borrowings through treasury bill issues must bemade in records maintained by MAS.    Hu said that instead of physical certificates having totravel back and forth at each transaction, with side trips tothe MAS for registration, the MAS will maintain a computerisedsystem for updating records in a central register.    Commercial banks and primary and registered governmentsecurities dealers will each have two securities accounts withthe MAS, one for their own holdings and the other for holdingson behalf of all their customers, Hu said.    All trades will be reflected daily in changes in theseaccounts, Hu said.    "These institutions will in turn act as custodians ofgovernment securities for their customers, rendering each anindividual accounting of his holdings."    Hu said the new system will cut storage and handling costsand paper work, reduce the danger of loss, theft, destructionand counterfeiting, and permit greater speed and efficiency inhandling large volumes of transactions.

Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about19 pct above the same year ago period. The rise was mainly dueto payment in January for a West German nuclear power stationwhich led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.

In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.    For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise betweenone and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.    Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, thecommunications and telecommunications sectors in particularshould contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.    But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of thedollar, Kaske said.    Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 groupnet profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in thesame period in the previous year.    Turnover in the first five months rose particularlystrongly in the installations and automotive technology,communications and telecommunications sectors, but componentsand energy and automation showed a sharp decline.    Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks inthe first five months of this year, or nine pct above theirlevel in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular byorders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.    Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. Anincrease in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroadwas balanced by the decline in the dollar.    While the installations and automotive technology sectorshowed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation andcommunications orders were below the level achieved in the sameperiod of 1985/86.    Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the samelevel.    Kaske said investments were expected to remain around sixbillion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previousyear. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.

Krupp GmbHKRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.    Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.    Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar'sweakness against the mark and oil and raw materials pricefalls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.    The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery andplant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.    Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineeringbusiness achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions hadunderpinned machinery and component activities.    An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, thetrading and services sectors, affected the group's total orderfigures.    However, "all business sectors contributed to the positiveresults achieved in 1986," Krupp added, without giving details.    Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marksfrom the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct oforders against 40 pct in 1985.    Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11member companies which comprise the core area of the group,rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.    The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks atend December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.    Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased bythree pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.    The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration inforeign trade and a downturn in a number of customerindustries.    The difficult market for sections and flats of qualitysteel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said.But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainlesscold rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms.

The ministry's parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georgvon Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports couldstart rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing thelower export trend which emerged in mid 1986.    But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be noneed to worry about the economy as long as the weakness ofexports did not affect currently good domestic demand.    Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good butnoted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. "Thisis certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not forstimulative steps," he said.    The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to workactively to promote free world trade, he added.    Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good exportopportunities. Price alone was not the only factor ininternational competitiveness, he said, adding German firmshave a reputation for high quality standards, prompt deliverytimes and good service.    Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficultposition on its trade figures.  It faced international pressureto reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worriedabout the effect of the mark's strength on the country'sexporters.    Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas,tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to arecord 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise wasdue entirely to the lower value of imports caused by thedecline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports havein fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.

The dollar's fall below 150 yen, which follows last month'sParis currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, WestGermany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal ofthe success of the Group of Five (G 5) 1985 New York Plazameeting to weaken the dollar, they said.    The G 5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar wasovervalued but this time the market and the authorities are ondifferent sides, dealers said.    Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G 5 nations hasencouraged the market to challenge the authorities despiteconcerted intervention by the central banks of the UnitedStates, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said.    Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa foraction to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend bycomments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there wasno target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway.    Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Parisaccord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said.    The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman PaulVolcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita,which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to ahalt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, theynoted.    The situation has again raised the question of whetherintervention can succeed against the trend in today's hugecurrency markets. Dealers said the market's cool response tointervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars.    "This means that the current dollar selling is not of asheer speculative nature but backed by real demand," said KoichiMiyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank.    Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite theintervention and it is only a matter of time before someoperators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed inTokyo today at 149.40 against New York's 149.30/40. Its recordlow was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday.    Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support torise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Sevenindustrial nations meets to discuss currencies again.    The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plusItaly) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currenciesapart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said.    Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could beused and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Parisaccord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing toprevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S.Trade deficit, especially with Japan.    Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for alower dollar is also limiting Washington's options, they said.    The market now thinks the central bank action is to slowthe dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, saidTadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.    Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected largeforward dollar sales from April to June for export billsfalling due for Japanese exporters from April to September.    The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yendepreciation, dealers said.    Yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looksineffective in light of this real demand, they said.    The market is also anticipating active institutional dollarsales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the newbusiness year starting April 1, dealers said.    "The market seems to have established a new dollar tradingrange between 147 and 149 yen," one dealer said.    The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Parisaccord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the lowend for the dollar against the yen, he said.    Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to145.

The forecast compares with the one pct GDP growth forecastmade by the Treasury last October.    Bank Negara also said in its annual report that grossnational product (GNP) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct,after declining 7.3 pct in 1986.    It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since lastNovember had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil andcommodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports.    Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipatedrise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustaintheir average GNP growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added.    Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil willaverage 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palmoil at 850 ringgit a tonne, tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a riseof 12 pct in manufacturing exports.    It said Malaysia's international terms of trade will turnaround to rise by two pct in 1987 after declining 12 pct in1986 and five pct in 1985.    "In 1987, income will be higher, private consumer spendingis likely to recover and expand... The budget will remain understrict control... The resource gap in the government's financeson current account will be bridged over the near term," BankGovernor Jaafar Hussein said in the report.    The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 1.19billion ringgit in 1986 or 1.8 pct of GNP from 1.79 billion or2.5 pct of the GNP the previous year.    The bank forecasts the inflation rate will increase by 1.5pct, after its 0.7 pct rise in 1986.

The "laundering" of drug and "insider dealing" money andcontroversy over accounts of the ousted Philippine and HaitianPresidents have hurt the standing of Swiss banks recently andstrained international relations, particularly with the UnitedStates.    Critics said the new code fell well short of demands forreform, doing little to close a key loophole in the requirementthat banks know the identity of their customers.    The Social Democratic party, a member of the rulingfour party coalition, which forced an unsuccesful 1984referendum to curb banking secrecy, complained the code stillfell short of the legal controls they wanted.    "It looks a slight improvement on paper, but the same trickswill still be possible in practice," Felix Meier, a senior partyofficial, told Reuters.    In contrast, Swiss lawyers are happy with the new code.    "Apart from a few nuances, we are very pleased with theagreement," said Max Oesch, a senior official of the SwissLawyers Federation, which has fought a long campaign to preventany curbs on lawyers' ability to act for their clients.    "It has shown that the 4,000 Swiss lawyers who do a good jobshould not be punished for the sake of getting at the one ortwo black sheep."    The role of lawyers has been at the centre of long runningdiscussions on the renewal of the so called "convention ofdiligence," a voluntary code of banking conduct introduced inresponse to a major banking scandal here in 1977.    With secrecy back in the public eye due to the FerdinandMarcos case and a Swiss bank link to the recently busted "PizzaConnection" international heroin ring, officials at the BankingCommission said earlier this year they wanted a tightening ofrules on anonymity.    However, the changes in the new code, which comes intooperation in October, have been minor.    Clients will still be able to keep their identity secretfrom the banks provided their lawyer pledges that therelationship with his client "is not only of a temporary nature"and involves provision of other legal services.    The Lawyers' Association said this part of their businessis very minimal anyway. In the majority of cases, people hadperfectly legal private or commercial reasons for not wantingthe bank to know their identity, Oesch said.    The Banking Commission, despite its earlier demand for avirtual abolition of the loophole, also said it was happy withthe new code.    However, critics complain that the agreement does not gofar enough to restrict the role of lawyers and could still becircumvented by criminals.    "No other group in society is allowed to regulate itself asmuch as the banks," complained Meier of the Social Democrats. "Ihope that the Banking Commission exercises its proper controlfunction."    However, other parts of the agreement won praise.    In particular, banks will also now be required to demandthe identity anyone doing more than 100,000 Swiss francs worthof business with them, even if they do not have an account atthe bank. Until now, the threshold was 500,000 francs.    Peter Kluser, head of the National Bank's legal department,which had argued for a lower limit, said the move could helpcombat the use of banks to "launder" or hide the criminal originof money.    The new code also clarifies the legal status of a tribunalable to impose heavy fines on banks which do not respect thecode.

In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leavingunchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against arecord 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.    The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat andcoarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mlnagainst 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mlnrise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.    The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 islikely to be down from last year as low world prices andrestrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.    At least four of the five major exporters expect to see adrop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. Thereis still potential for even higher average wheat yields but theIWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.    Although it is still early to assess the coarse grainoutlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in theEuropean Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area isexpected lower but oat sowings could rise.    After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Unionplans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mlnhectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields arelikely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improvedweather and a further increase in the use of intensivecultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Sovietmaize output in 1987, the IWC said.    Any reduction in world coarse grain output would bebolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWCsaid.    It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks atendof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mlntonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.    After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mlntonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs ofanother large crop this coming season with higher outputexpected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.

Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, withexpectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharplynarrower than January's 527 mln deficit.    "The figures are unreservedly good," Chase ManhattanSecurities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.    Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weakermorning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted indexagainst a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged fromyesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.    The market had feared that a deteriorating non oil tradepattern would undermine international support for sterling,which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K.Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begunto doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending ratesto 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current accountdeficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, Wroblewski said.    Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in Februaryto 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips andDrew said the faster rise in exports than imports would provepartly aberrational in coming months. He forecast theChancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumerexpenditure on imported goods.    However, Warburg Securities economist Ian Harwood said hisfirm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficitforecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billionstg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.    He said news of strong growth in exports of non oil goodsconfirmed recent bullish surveys among members of theConfederation of British Industry.    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even ifJanuary's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseasgoods and import intensive stock building among manufacturers,Harwood said.    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2point on the better than expected news, as earlier worriesabout the figures evaporated.    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settlingto a steady 1.6050 about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher thanthe European low of 1.5960.    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in marketsentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market waslargely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that theConservative government's support was slipping.    LONDON, March 26   The Bank of England said it provided 15mln stg in assistance to the money market this morning, buyingbank bills in band two at 9 13/16 pct.    Earlier the Bank revised its money market liquidityforecast from a flat position to a deficit of around 350 mlnstg.

"I am very concerned about the Brazilian economy," he toldreporters after a news conference in Tokyo.    He said Brazil had caught the attention of the world withits decision last month to stop paying interest on its loansfrom commercial banks but warned it not to sqaunder the time itgained by failing to come up with a new economic program.    Brazil's decision jolted the world's financial community asthe country is 108 billion dlrs in debt, including some 68billion owed to commercial banks.    Brazilian Finance Ministry sources said in Brasiliayesterday that the country was preparing a new economicstrategy designed to ensure domestic economic growth.    Despite mounting domestic and overseas pressure, Brazil hassaid repeatedly that it will not go to the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) for help in drawing up a new plan for fearthat will only throw its economy into recession.    Conable said the country may be able to get away with notgoing to the IMF for help, but will need an IMF type economicprogram if it wants to regain the confidence of lenders.    Outsiders like the World Bank are reluctant to suggestpossible solutions to Brazil's economic problems because of thedelicate political situation there, he added.    While the World Bank has a role to play in helping Brazil,it canot replace the IMF as an overseer of the economy,Conable said. He added that the Fund can be very flexible inits dealings with developing countries, adjusting its approachto the political realities.    Brazil still seems willing to talk to the Fund under theannual discussions that all IMF members undertake, Conablesaid, adding that this could partially solve the currentstalemate.    During his news conference, Conable said the World Bankbacked U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's Third World debtinitiative, which calls for stepped up lending to heavilyindebted Third World countries adopting economic policies.    "The World Bank believes the Baker initiative is the bestapproach," he said. "Debt forgiveness is difficult to design inany fair way and also will tend to discourage furtherinvestment and development."    He cited the recent multi billion dollar debt package forMexico, the Third World's most indebted country after Brazil.    "Will it work?" he asked. "We don't know...But we think itmore likely to work than any of the alternatives suggested."    Conable, who is here to meet government and businessleaders, expressed confidence that Japan will make increasinguse of its huge trade surplus to help developing countries.    "We are quite confident Japan will make an increasinginvestment in development because of their willingness tosupport institutions like ours in increasing ways with eachpassing year," he said.

A policy of cutting wheat production could lead tounemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could thenlead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.    The IWC outlines three courses of action open togovernments in wheat exporting countries.    They could continue to support prices in the hope that whenthe world economy improves demand for wheat will rise andsurpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.    Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat whichcould be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a longperiod.    This option may prove to be the most politicallyunattractive and would result in many producers abandoningwheat production, the report said.    The third option would be for governments to distinguishbetween the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,possibly varying support prices according to farm size oroverall production.    The IWC review covers support prices in the major exportingcountries since 1982. At some time during that period all theproducers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.    These changes did not always result in lower exportsubsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations morethan offset lower prices in the domestic currency.    For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC interventionprice for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 Europeancurrency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in whichmost export transactions are denominated, the interventionprice however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost ofsupporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequersand some governments are now searching for ways to cutexpenditure, the report says.    The proportion of world wheat output produced by the fivemajor exporters declined in the period covered by the surveyfrom 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due toincreased production in China and India.    The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this wascountered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by loweracreages.    In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 percent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch toother enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

"I don't think it's (a tax increase) is a very good ideaand I'm quite confident that President Reagan doesn't thinkit's a very good idea," Baker said in an interview on CableNews Network's "Moneyline" television program.    He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNPwhich is traditionally where it has been, but the FederalGovernment is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker saidspending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits.    Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed byHouse Speaker Jim Wright, D Tex, or other special taxes.    "The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunateapproach to take," the Treasury Secretary said. He said theUnited States has some of the most efficient capital markets inthe world and new taxes would impair efficiency.    On the international front, Baker said banks must do morelending to developing countries. He was questioned about thisafter the Standard and Poor's Corp downgrading today of thedebt of six major money center bank holding companies, largelybecause of their heavy developing nation loan exposure.    Baker said that developing countries must adopt free marketeconomic policies such as in the United States. He said capitalflows will be required to support the needed reforms in theeconomic systems of those countries.    The money must come either through equity or debt and Bakersaid that developing nations' "investment regimes do notsupport enough equity investment, so you've got to have somedebt there."    Commenting on the U.S. trade deficit, Baker said "I thinkyou're going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction thisyear."

He told a press briefing Wednesday that Manila has droppeda two tier interest payment offer, which would have given banksa higher return if they took partial payment in new Philippineinvestment notes (PINs) instead of in cash.    "The PINs proposal has been laid aside.... The discussion isnow on pricing (of just the cash payments)," he said.    Foreign banking sources in Manila said on Tuesday that thePhilippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 7/8over the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) but Ongpin wouldnot discuss details of the pricing negotiations.    He also refused to speculate on when an overall agreementmight be reached. The talks have been going on for more thanthree weeks.    Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8over LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs   tradeable,dollar denominated, zero coupon notes that could potentiallyyield up to one point over LIBOR.    The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee atleast a 7/8 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still hadgrave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for otherlarge debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.    The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as aseparate option for those banks, which might want to fund theirown investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in thesecondary market, Ongpin said.    Under Manila's plan, the PINs would be redeemable at fullface value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investmentsat any time prior to their six year maturity date.    While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINsproposal, Ongpin said there was great interest on the part ofcertain investment banks which are already active in thesecondary market for sovereign debt.    Unlike current debt/equity schemes, Ongpin said, the PINswould include no government fees and would be free from"administrative hassles."    He said about six investment banks had been approached andfour had replied so far. One even showed interest in buying 45mln dlrs worth of notes, he said.    Ongpin said that by funding current interest payments inthe secondary market through the PINs scheme, the Philippinescould conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreignexchange reserves during its planned seven year restructuringperiod.

Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later thisyear, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche LandesbankGirozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by theU.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.    "A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stockexchanges," Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned forfurther rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.    Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.    Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, manyinvestors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.    Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stockexchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.    Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG'sforeign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold ispoised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second halfof this year.    The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs anounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.

"We are one of the few banks that would have an improvedposition," Pinola said in an interview, noting First Interstatehas fewer off balance sheet liabilities than many other banks.    Under the proposed rules, a bank's minimum capitalrequirement would be determined by the assessed risk of theirassets, including off balance sheet liabilities that are notcurrently taken into account.    Currently, banks must retain a primary capital ratio of 5.5pct.    First Interstate reported a primary capital ratio of 6.14pct at the end of 1986.    Pinola said First Interstate has since raised that ratio,however, to about 6.70 pct, through a recent preferred stockoffering and a 200 mln dlr subordinated capital note offeringannounced yesterday.    First Interstate reported a relatively average return onassets ratio of 0.68 at the end of 1986.    Pinola said First Interstate's return on assets ratio willimprove to the 0.70 0.71 range at the end of the first quarter,because 1986 year end assets, at 55.4 billion dlrs, wereoverestimated by about two billion dlrs.    He said he is anxious to improve the return on assets ratiofurther, but continued loan losses at First Interstate's RockyMountain state banks continue to hold down profits.    Pinola said its banks in other states are showing excellentreturn on asset ratios, with its Arizona and Washington banksrunning at about 1.30, its Oregon bank showing 1.00 and itsCalifornia bank at about 0.83.

He told the annual meeting 80 pct of last year's sales camefrom products made in the U.S.. He added Siemens was asinterested as U.S. Authorities in reducing the massive tradedeficit and calming down trade relations.    "But we would show no understanding if this (trade deficitreduction) was attempted through means incompatible with theprinciple of free world trade," Kaske said.    Siemens has been the subject of pressure by U.S.Telecommunications authorities to limit its access to the U.S.Market for digital telephone switching equipment.    The Federal Communications Commission announced in Decemberit was starting an enquiry into the blocking of free access tothe telecommunications market by foreign firms, with officerssaying reciprocal access was not available to U.S. Firmsabroad.    For years Siemens was the only supplier of public switchingstations to the Bundespost, the German federal post office.Regulatory authorities in 1982 opened Bundespost contracts totenders from other domestic and foreign suppliers.    But foreign authorities have complained that too manyrestrictions to overseas suppliers still remain.    Kaske said neither Siemens nor the Bundespost could be heldresponsible for the U.S. Trade deficit and noted the U.S. Wasstill achieving substantial surpluses in trade with WestGermany in the electrical and telecommunications sector.    The Bundespost is far more open to supplies from abroadthan telephone companies in the U.S. Japan or France, he added.

Christopher Brougham, regional manager, rescheduling unit,at Lloyds Bank Plc, said in response to a Reuter enquiry, thatthe six major U.K. Clearing banks last week sent a telex toCitibank saying they would contribute what was requestedprovided all other major lenders did the same and that the U.S.Banks contribute at least 90 pct of the amount required bythem.    Other bankers, who declined to be identified, said othergroups of banks particularly those in Switzerland, France andCanada, were equally reluctant to sign, although they had notsent any telex to Citibank, which chairs Mexico's 13 bankadvisory group.    However, they said it was likely that if and when theBritish banks sign the accord, the others are likely to follow.    Under the agreement, for which the signing began on Friday,commercial banks are being asked to contribute 12.9 pct oftheir exposure to Mexico as of August 1982. That was the dateof the first Mexican debt crisis.    After months of haggling, a proposed rescheduling agreementfor Mexico was struck last September during the annual meetingof the World Bank and International Monetary Fund inWashington.    Ever since then the advisory group, of which Lloyds is amember, has been attempting to round up the needed signatories.    However, there has been considerable resistance to thepackage, partly because of some of the clauses it contains andpartly because many small U.S. Regional banks do not want toincrease their exposure to any Latin American countries.    Brougham said, "We (British banks) have always played alongfor Mexico and will do so as long as others share equally."    The decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the sixclearers jointly, but each sent its own telex.    In addition to Lloyds, telexes were sent by NationalWestminster Bank Plc, Barclays Bank Plc, Midland Bank Plc,tandard Chartered Bank Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.    Brougham noted that so far the U.S. Banks have only reached83 1/2 pct of the total that is expected from them, while thelevel of contributions from the U.K. Banks is well in excess of90 pct. "The U.S. Figure should be closer to ours," he said.    Many bankers have been angered by the resistance of theregional U.S. Banks, noting that even if they don't contributeto the new loan they still will be receiving interest on theexisting loans.    The banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement andbankers are hoping all will go according to plan.    In the meantime, bankers expect further pressure will beexercised on the regional banks and the major U.S. Banks tofind a solution to the problem. Many have suggested that thelarger U.S. Banks should take on the additional obligations,but so far they have resisted this.    Bankers expect that much of the pressure on the U.S. Bankswill come from U.S. Regulators, notably the Federal Reserve.    Bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the Britishbanks and other national groups as "a matter of principal, andburden sharing" rather than as a "pressure tactic" to force theU.S. Banks to make up their share.    The bankers are not the only ones to be upset by theprotracted negotiations surrounding the agreement.    The Mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays. Atthe signing in New York last Friday, Finance Minister GustavoPetricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks.    "Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico willcontinue to be open and willing to share with them the businessopportunities which its future growth will create," Petriciolisaid.    Conversion of bank debt into equity investments in Mexicois one option banks can take advantage of to reduce theirexposure. But Mexico halted its debt for equity program inFebruary in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package.    On Friday, Petricioli said "We will be a lot moreexpeditious in processing the requests of banks that havesupported us."    The pressure on the U.S. Banks comes at a time when othermajor Latin American debtors are in the process of crucial debtnegotiations.    Brazil, the third world's largest debtor, has suspended allinterest payments on its 109 billion dlrs of foreign debt. Manyof the major U.S. Banks, including Citibank, have already saidthey might have to put their Brazil loans on a cash basis andtake the financial losses, which could total billions ofdollars.    This would be required by U.S. Banking regulations if theinterest payments are more than 90 days overdue.    However, the U.S. Banks are not the only ones threatened byregulations. In the U.K., A proposed Inland Revenue rulingwould affect the tax treatment of certain types of loans, manyof which are made to Latin American countries.    Basically, the ruling wants to limit the tax credit a bankcan claim for tax withheld by foreign governments on loaninterest payments.    The British banks are planning to fight the proposals astheir implementation could prove extremely costly, not just interms of compliance but in limiting future business.

The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comesafter the previous record set last June 6 of 1,240 billionpesetas.    A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higherovernight call money rates were expected in the short term inview of disappointing money supply figures for February.    The M 4 money supply, measured as liquid assets in publichands, rose 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January andcompared with this year's eight pct target. Money supply growthwas 11.4 pct last year.    The central bank on Tuesday raised overnight rates by aquarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on demand for 746billion pesetas. Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of theyear and have been increased to drain liquidity on risingdemand for funds. "The policy is proving counter productive andrates will have to come down in the long term," the bankspokesman said in reply to Reuters enquiries.    He said higher rates were fuelling an influx of short termspeculative capital from abroad.    "At least 800 mln dlrs of current excess liquidity in thesystem is convertible pesetas from West Germany and othercountries with much lower rates," he said.

Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, withexpectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharplynarrower than January's 527 mln deficit.    "The figures are unreservedly good," Chase ManhattanSecurities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.    Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weakermorning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted indexagainst a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged fromyesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.    The market had feared that a deteriorating non oil tradepattern would undermine international support for sterling,which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K.Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begunto doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending ratesto 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current accountdeficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.    Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose inFebruary to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips andDrew said that the faster rise in exports than imports wouldprove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast theChancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expeditureon imported goods.    However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, saidhis firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficitforecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billionstg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.    He said news of strong growth in exports of non oil goodsconfirmed recent bullish surveys among members of theConfederation of British Industry.    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even ifJanuary's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseasgoods and import intensive stock building among manufactureres,Harwood said.    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2point on the better than expected news, as earlier worriesabout the figures evaporated.    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settlingto a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higherthan the European low of 1.5960.    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in marketsentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market waslargely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that theConservative government's support was slipping.    The Marplan poll, published in "Today," showed Conservativesupport had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while theAlliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party,whose own support fell from 38 pct.    The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greetedenthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have leftthe voters indifferent, political observers said.    Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warnthat today's improved sentiment could be dented if support forPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.    This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, whichare all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcominggeneral election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,Harwood said. "The news did come as a very, very substantialrelief," he said.    However, on the interest rate front, economists cautionthat Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable byencouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson hadalready got an inflation reducing cut in mortgage rates inresponse to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons forlower rates have been curtailed.

Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later thisyear, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche LandesbankGirozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by theU.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.    "A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stockexchanges," Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned forfurther rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.    Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.    Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, manyinvestors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.    Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stockexchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.    Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG'sforeign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold ispoised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second halfof this year.    The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs anounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.

In testimony prepared for delivery before a Senate bankingsubcommittee, Mulford said there was broad recognition in Paristhat "further substantial exchange rate shifts could damagegrowth and adjustment prospects."    But he also said while there are clear understandings amongthe countries regarding cooperation, "We have refrained fromestablishing a system of target zones or ranges."    Mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out theway in which they intend to deal with possible marketdevelopments.    He said governments must retain flexibility in dealing withexchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigidexchange rate objectives "or to specify too precisely the goalsof intervention" would hurt official attempts to react tomarket pressures, he said.    Accordingly, Mulford said setting specific currencyobjectives and intervention to achieve those objectives wouldbe counterproductive.    Commenting on the trade deficit, Mulford reiterated theTreasury position that the current account deficit will declinefrom 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs thisyear, due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18months.    But he added trade imbalances would also be corrected bycommitments from West Germany and Japan to stimulate theireconomies and by U.S. efforts to cut the budget deficit andenhance U.S. competitiveness.    He also said some newly industrialized countries should lettheir currencies appreciate.

World sales, which began on October 20, 1986, reached 2.193mln ounces in less than six months of sales. This made it worldmarket leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said.    Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all goldEagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were inEurope and about eight pct in Asia.    She said despite introduction of several new gold bullioncoins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preservethe Eagle's strong market share with extensive publicity.    The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins,as long as this is available at market prices. The remaininggold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from theopen market, Pope said.    Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition herefrom the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent fromthe South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple Leaf'sWest German market share at 60 pct.    The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buygold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pctvalue added tax imposed here. Including the tax, the one ouncecoins traded today at 906 marks, they said.    Competition may also come from new gold coins, includingBelgium's ECU, which began sales today. Britain and Australiaalso have plans to mint gold bullion coins, the analysts said.

In testimony before a Senate banking subcommittee, Mulfordsaid he based this prediction on progress in talks betweenbanks and Mexico, Chile, and Venezuela, as well as progress innegotiations with the Philippines.    "These agreements, together with others for Argentina andwe hope Brazil," should assure substantial new loans this year,Mulford said.    Mulford defended the U.S. strategy for handling the debtcrisis and added additional steps, like development bycommercial banks of a menu of options to support debtor reform,can be undertaken.    That particular development would maintain broad bankparticipation in new financing packages to debtors.    Mulford stessed that greater flexibility in devising newmoney packages may be essential for future bank syndications.    "The commercial banks have much to gain from taking thelead themselves to develop the kinds of ideas that help assurethe concerted lending process works," he said.    In particular, Mulford said banks and debtor nations willincreasingly move toward repricing, retiming or reschedulingagreements as an alternative to new loans.    "The benefits of such approaches may be substantial andmay, in the right circumstances, be easier to achieve than newmoney packages," he said.    But for debtors with substantial financing needs, newlending will still be necessary, he said.    Mulford rejected congressional ideas for a debt facility asbeing far too costly to creditor governments, and ultimatelytaxpayers.    Mulford urged further development of debt equity swaps aswell as broader mutual funds for conversion into equity.    As in the past, Mulford said progress must be founded oneconomic reforms and sufficient new financing for debtors bothto support those reforms and generate new growth.

They said a Libyan force of some 3,000 men was abandoningthe oasis of Faya Largeau but added that severe sand stormsacross Chad could be delaying the pull out and an expectedgovernment strike on the town.    Swirling clouds of sand, which have closed the capital ofN'Djamena to commercial flights for two days, have sharplyreduced visibility and made it difficult to determine the exactsituation around Faya, French military officials said.    The hurried Libyan evacuation, which started yesterdaymorning, follows the capture on Sunday of Libya's best defendedand vitally important air base at Ouadi Doum, 145 kms (90miles) northeast of Faya.    The fall of Ouadi Doum, which Chad said cost 1,269 Libyanlives, deprived Libya of its only hard surface runway in Chadcapable of taking Soviet made bombers and transport planes andleft Faya Largeau isolated and encircled by government troops.    Libyan forces are reported to have blown up stocks of fueland ammunition on Tuesday night before starting to fleenorthwards towards the Tibesti mountain region, which adjoinsLibya's southern border.

Although primary smelting costs have declined generally inrecent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offeredby secondary smelters will continue to make re melted materialincreasingly attractive.    It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricityto produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said.    On the demand side, developments in automobiles andpackaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption.    Automobile production, although expected to fall this year,is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for theforeseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castingsis gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry,particularly in the U.S.    In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium todominate the beverage can market in any of the other majoreconomies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there isevidence recycling is on the increase in other countries.    In addition to the cost savings involved, technologyadvances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced bythe secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said.    There is not likely to be a problem of availability as theU.S. Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true ofseveral European countries, albeit on a smaller scale.

Balladur told an Economist conference that on the productside, a series of new contracts, including share options andforward contracts in European Currency Units (ECUs), would beintroduced shortly for trading on the Paris bourse.    The scope of the new bill, however, was to transform theorganisation of equity trading, allowing participants both toperform a banking role and to trade in equities, he said.    "Currently, the French market is based on the Napoleonicprinciple of separation of equity trading and banking. Thisprinciple has become a dividing, and therefore a weakening,factor for the market," Balladur said.    He said under the planned new rules, stock brokers,currently very specialised and undercapitalised, would be freeto link up with powerful financial institutions after afive year transition period.    Stock brokerages would be subject to legislation similar tothat in the U.K. And U.S., He said, adding the Paris marketwould actively attempt to attract foreign securities houses.    Balladur said the French securities market had enjoyedstrong growth in the past 10 years, with new share and bondissues totalling 430 billion French francs in 1986, comparedwith 53 billion in 1976.    New share issues alone totalled 63 billion francs in 1986,up 230 pct from the 1985 level of 19 billion francs, he said.    Total market capitalisation stood at 3,200 billion francsat end 1986, compared with 400 billion 10 years earlier, whilestock and bond trades were valued at 2,200 billion francs lastyear against 56 billion in 1976, he said.    Balladur, who also had private talks with U.K. PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher and Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson, said his government was also preparing a bill toliberalise the French insurance sector.    Under the proposed rules, an independent regulatoryinsurance commission will be set up. The commission will beendowed with powers similar to those of a body set up earlierto monitor the banking sector, Balladur said.    He said the new bill would also aim to adapt insuranceregulation to take account of the ever closer integration ofall areas of finance.

Het Comite has been co ordinating national actions againstalleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and,since December, has lodged more than 80 individual cases withthe Business Appeal Court in The Hague.    The basic complaint is that the levy does not take accountof currency cross rates of exchange and therefore compoundersin countries with strong currencies may have to pay more intheir own currency than is paid to them by producers in anothercountry.    Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement thatcompanies can pay the amount they receive toward the levyrather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch graincommodity board.    The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial andlegal backing to the test case in the Business AdministrationCourt in the Hague. Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10.    The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the companyfor the test case from among the 80 lodged "because the bill(the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of thelevy contained significant currency distortions and involvedgrain from a wide variety of origins." The name of the companyis not being made public.    The Administration Court is not expected to make a finalruling on the case in the near future. The Het Comite spokesmansaid it was very likely it would refer questions to the AppealCourt in Luxembourg, and "as a result it could easily be anothernine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved."    Meanwhile, the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders areputting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutchgovernment to follow through on earlier statements and seek acomplete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy iscollected, the spokesman said.    Het Comite, as a member of FEFAC, the association ofEuropean animal feed manufacturers, is also a party to actionsprotesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court.

He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Fivenations and Canada agreed in Paris to "see if there can't be aperiod of reasonable stability instead of volatility" to givetime for the committments in Paris to take place.    Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R Tex) whether U.S. interventionwas not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied thatthe administration judged that after economic adjustments,current exchange rates reflect underlying economicfundamentals.    In particular, the stability sought by the nations wouldallow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economiesdomestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulfordsaid in his testimony.    He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar wouldhurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth.    Mulford noted that half of West Germany's economy wasaffected by international developments.    He also said increased Japanese domestic growth wouldresult in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarilylead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Grammasserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market.    Commenting on the Paris agreement, Mulford said, "I thinkexchange rates ought to be stabilized so (Germany's andJapan's) efforts can be carried out.    Mulford rejected Gramm's argument that faster domesticgrowth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lowerdollar.    Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a patternof higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U.S. tradedeficit.    Otherwise, he said, the trade deficit would be resolvedeither through a much lower dollar or a U.S. recession, bothalternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable.

But they said recent central bank intervention in theforeign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction totemporary pressures rather than a major defence operation.    A Bank of France spokesman declined all comment but sourcesclose to the central bank said it had also intervenedyesterday.    Dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert withthe Bundesbank and Bank of Japan.    The sources said the French central bank could have been inthe market again today in two way operations, not necessarilyon its own account, but to counter short term pressures arisingfrom the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31.    One major French bank said it bought between five and 15mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149.28 to thedollar.    Another bank said it had been asked by the Bank of Franceto say it was in the market, a departure from the centralbank's usual insistence on confidentiality.    But other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention,which they said appeared to be on a very limited scale.    "Even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs, you wouldstill be talking of a small overall amount," said one dealer.    Recent intervention by the Bank of Japan appeared mainly tohave been required to meet year end window dressing demand foryen. "This is a specific short term phenomenon rather than awider trend," the dealer said.    Operators have been extremely cautious about testing thedollar's trading ranges against the West German mark andJapanese yen.    These ranges were set in February's stabilisation agreementreached here by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and theFinance Ministers of Japan, Germany, France, Britain andCanada.    But speculative pressures started to build again this weekafter Baker was quoted on British television at the weekend asrepeating earlier statements that Washington had no target forthe dollar.    Baker yesterday moved to defuse speculation he was talkingthe dollar down, telling a Cable News Network interviewer and aSenate committee he stood by the Paris agreement. Foreignexchange markets had been misreading his comments, he said.

Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with majorproducers and consumers this morning to resolve outstandingdifferences, mostly on the issues of how much non member cocoathe buffer stock can purchase and price differentials fordifferent varieties.    Delegates were fairly confident the differences could beworked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow.    Some consuming member nations, including Britain andBelgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pctnon member cocoa, delegates have said.    The consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower qualitynon member cocoas, particularly Malaysian, will mosteffectively support prices because that low quality cocoa iscurrently pressuring the market.    Producers, meanwhile, say non member cocoa should make upat most a very small percentage of the buffer. They sayMalaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless itis a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoaMalaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said.    As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higherdifferential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recentproposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoabought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said.    Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a waythat would not promote buffer stock purchases of the moreexpensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said.    Other technical points need to be sorted out, includinglimits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy innearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequenteffect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said.

The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemensat the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT.The result of the negotiations was still open.    Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer.    The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairmanJames E.

The French government has limited CGCT participation byforeign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francsfor the whole company.

Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firmJeumont Schneider SA> submitted a joint offer at the start ofMarch because of the 20 pct limitation. Both companies willform a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT.   Siemens will have a 20 pct stake in the new company whileJeumont Schneider will own 80 pct.

He said that with the move, called a "standstill"arrangement, Brazil was only trying to avoid difficulties topay its 109 billion dlrs debt in the future.    The spokesman told Reuters that Brazil's suggestion will becommunicated by telex to Brazil's 700 bank creditors.    The spokesman declined to give details of what was includedin the statement, but said Central Bank president FranciscoGros was seeking a 60 day extension of the short term creditlines from its commercial bank creditors.    The amount of these credit lines totals 15 billion dollars,and deadline for payment is set for March 31.    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said in a televisioninterview it was "absolutely important" for Brazil and itscreditors to renew the short term credit lines, as Brazil mustfinance its exports.    "If these credit lines were cut, we would face difficultiesto honour our foreign debt in the future," Funaro said.    "There is evidently a common interest in the matter," he said.    Funaro said, however, he was told creditors understandBrazil's position and do not wish to turn the negotiation forthe renewal of the credit lines more difficult.    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs debt to commercial banks and froze short termtrade and money market lines.    He said Brazil's suggestion is part of its demands "beforethe need to renew the mechanisms of loans in the world."    Funaro said currently debt negotiations are "very complexand complicated," mentioning cases of countries which had towait some 10 months before getting a reply from creditors.    "We are not interested in confrontation, but we would likethe loan mechanisms to show that the crisis belongs to bothsides," Funaro said.    Funaro denied rumours that he had offered his resignationto President Jose Sarney.    "Who decides whether to keep or dismiss his ministers is thepresident. Everything else is nothing but speculation," he said.

Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pcttreasury bill rate as a difficult month end approached.    But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikelyto encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely forfear of upsetting the current wage round.    One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, "Idon't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whateverhappens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all itwants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes."    In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the groundfor triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessmentsof growth and inflation, economists said.    Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if theBundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in themedium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.    As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no movethat would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said.    In the current round, the country's most powerful union,the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, isdemanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from thepresent 38 1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.    The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, isoffering to bring in a 38 hour week from July 1, 1988, and givea two stage wage increase   a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 thisyear and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.    The agreement forged by IG Metall   Europe's largestunion, with 2.5 mln members   and the employers would set thebenchmark for settlements in other industries such as thepublic sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiationsbegan in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude byearly April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June.    Though many economists said the unions' current warningstrikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy andwould not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven weekstrikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly ontheir positions and there could still be conflict.    This could extend the length of time in which theBundesbank would keep its activity low key, economists said.    The money market head said the unions' humiliation by theprotracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperativehousing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.    "The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put thissquarely onto the account in the negotiations," he said.    In addition, the newly elected chairman of the IG Metallunion, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined thanhis predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battleto achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.    More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly insouth Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hoursyesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH andaerospace group Messerschmitt Boelkow Blohm GmbH.    Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out inwarning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said.    Money market dealers said that overnight call money rateswould rise in the near future in any case and did not depend ona politically inhibited Bundesbank.    About eight billion marks were coming into the markettomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.    As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offerto mop up liquidity via the sale of three day treasury bills,anticipating still lower rates before the month end.    But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customerswas due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short ofliquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling.    Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.

In a wide ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking forways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,"so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain ourindependence, if possible."    In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the majorEast Coast banks to buy banks in California.    First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, andthe nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 westernstates and has franchise operations in four additional states.    Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target forlarge U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the lucrative California market and the West Coast region.    While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, whenasked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,"That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naivenot to think that."    Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as"opportunistic".    He said he will look for banks in management trouble thathe can get at a bargain, then add management to restoreprofitability, or for banks in states where First Interstatealready operates, then cut costs by combining resources.    The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said mostof the banks are already well managed, but might be purchasedat a discount because of the depressed regional economy.    Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might movehim to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, "Wecontinue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot ofpeople continue to monitor and look at us."    Banking analysts, however, consider another FirstInterstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happenany time soon.    Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, "a very,very difficult decision."    With that decision made, however, he acknowledged FirstInterstate may now have a difficult time keeping its numberfour position in the California banking community.    "The competition in this state is tough," he said, notingCityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branchesfrom Sears Roebuck company. "CityBank is moving rapidly to moveus down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth," he said.    Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that SecurityPacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona,Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regionalcompetitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.    "Security is, has been and continues to be a highlyprofitable and obviously well managed company," he said.    He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has theadvantages of having owned and managed regional banks longerand has the recognition advantage of having given its regionalbanks a common name.    Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in goodfinancial condition, First Interstate continues to sustainserious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.    Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,he said, "I don't think it has bottomed out, because I thinkmost of the problems are real estate related and the realestate problems are going to be with us for several years."    Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture inthe Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate'sfranchise operation.    First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer FirstInterstate financial services in ten states.    While a year ago he was considering taking his franchiseoperation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said becausemost of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion intothe Midwest must come first.    Calling the franchise system, "moderately profitable,"Pinola said, "It is going to take a rejuvenation of theagriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speedwe were generating before the last year or two."    On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only bankswith minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.

He said that with the move, called a "standstill"arrangement, Brazil was only trying to avoid difficulties inpaying its 109 billion dlrs of debt in the future.    The spokesman told Reuters that Brazil's suggestion will becommunicated by telex to Brazil's 700 bank creditors. Hedeclined to give details of the statement, but said CentralBank president Francisco Gros was seeking a 60 day extension ofshort term credit lines from its commercial bank creditors.    The amount of these credit lines totals 15 billion dlrs,and deadline for payment is set for March 31.    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said in a televisioninterview that it was "absolutely important" for Brazil and itscreditors to renew the short term credit lines, as Brazil mustfinance its exports.    "If these credit lines were cut, we would face difficultiesto honour our foreign debt in the future," Funaro said.    "There is evidently a common interest in the matter," hesaid.    Funaro said, however, he was told creditors understandBrazil's position and do not wish to make the negotiation forthe renewal of the credit lines more difficult.    Funaro explained that Brazil's suggestion is part of itsdemands "before the need to renew the mechanisms of loans in theworld."    He said that the current negotiating process is "verycomplex and complicated," mentioning cases of countries whichhad to wait some 10 months before getting a reply fromcreditors.    "We are not interested in confrontation, but we would likethe loan mechanisms to show that the crisis belongs to bothsides," Funaro said.    Funaro denied rumours that he had offered his resignationto President Jose Sarney.    "Who decides whether to keep or dismiss his ministers is thepresident. Everything else is nothing but speculation," he said.    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs of debt to commercial banks and froze short termtrade and money market lines.
