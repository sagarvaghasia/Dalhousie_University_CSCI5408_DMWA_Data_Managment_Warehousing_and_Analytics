She was speaking to parliament after senior members of theruling Conservative Party urged her to call elections due inJune 1988 a year early in the wake of two more opinion pollsgiving her party a commanding lead.    Asked by a Conservative back bencher for an assurance thatthe decision was hers alone, and did not depend on "media hype,pressure and speculation," she replied: "The date of the nextelection will be decided by Downing Street, not Fleet Street."    Downing Street is the Prime Minister's official residence,Fleet Street the traditional home of the British nationalpress.    A Harris poll for the breakfast time program TV AM gave theTories 43 pct of the vote, representing a majority of 132 seatsin parliament, their biggest lead since the party's landslidevictory in the 1983 elections.    In The Times of London, a MORI poll gave the Tories a 92seat majority. It was the sixth poll to show the ruling partywith a big lead over the opposition Labour Party and thefast improving centrist Alliance.    Leading the chorus urging Thatcher to go to the polls inJune, Sir Marcus Fox, vice chairman of the influential 1922committee of Conservative back benchers, said: "I have alwaysfelt that it would be June, and this reinforces my view.    "I always thought June was right. We have got most of ourlegislation through and to go beyond that I do not think wouldbe in the national interest."    Another Tory back bencher, Anthony Beaumont Dark, said: "Ihave always been an October man, but I think it would be goodto get it out of the way now."    Their comments came as government officials dismissedspeculation about a snap election to coincide with local pollsin May, timed to reap maximum advantage from the recentpopularity surge, Thatcher's successful trip to Moscow andLabour's current popularity slump.    Calls for a May poll were also prompted by Tory concernover a steady advance by the Alliance, and the possibility thatif it continues it could rob the Conservatives of an overallmajority in parliament.    Today's MORI poll showed an Alliance gain of eight pointsover the past month in around 100 key marginal seats where theoutcome of the next election is likely to be decided.

With the G 5 meeting in Washington ahead of this week's IMFinterim committee, traders remained reluctant to open any largepositions. Towards the end of the day the dollar firmed afterfailing earlier to hold beneath 1.82 marks. Some dealers saidSenate testimony from Fed Chairman Paul Volcker also lentsupport.    The dollar closed at 1.8265/75 marks after opening at1.8200/15 and closing yesterday at 1.8260/70.    Volcker said that a further sizeable dollar decline couldbe counter productive, and that exchange rate adjustments havebeen enough to narrow the U.S. Trade deficit.    Such remarks in the past might have moved the dollarsharply, today they only pushed it up 20 or 30 basis pointswhen it was already firming for technical reasons.    The dollar in any case held in a narrow range today,trading early in the morning just below 1.82 marks and risingto a high of 1.8270.    Dealers said they were awaiting comments after the G 5meeting from U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker.    Looking slightly further ahead, the market is awaiting U.S.February trade data, due on April 14.    Another set of disappointing figures could push the dollarbelow its recent 1.80 85 mark range if there have been nosupportive statements from G 5 officials in Washington in themeantime, dealers said.    Sterling closed slightly easier at 2.950/954 marks, afteropening at 2.951/955 and closing yesterday at 2.954/958.    The pound has been buoyed by expectations the rulingConservatives will win the next U.K. Election.    But dealers said sterling now looks high against the markand room for further gains must be limited.    Many dealers believe sterling will enter the EMS jointfloat after a U.K. Election. In this case, its ceiling couldwell be at or near 2.95 marks, dealers said.    The yen closed at 1.2550/70 marks per 100 after closingyesterday at 1.2490/2510, and the Swiss franc firmed to120.55/70 marks per 100 from 120.10/50.    The French franc ended unchanged at 30.04/07 marks per 100.

Last month, Liffe saw record monthly futures volume at 1.15mln lots, and record monthly options volume at 97,700. TotalLiffe volume in first quarter 1987 rose to 2.8 mln contracts,or 89 pct up on the same 1986 period.    Long gilt turnover in first quarter 1987 was 300 pct up onthe year ago period at 1.63 mln lots versus 409,500. But T bondvolume fell by 38 pct to 244,500 in first three months 1987.    Jenkins told Reuters the higher volumes for gilts reflectedin part the volatility in the U.K. Markets in recent months,while the falloff in T bonds was an indication of the relativestability of U.S. Credit markets.    Jenkins said he saw room for the whole financial futuressector to grow further in the coming months. In particular, FT SE 100 futures had great scope for expansion, and turnover inthem should be much higher by end 1987.    FT SE futures volume was 62,700 in first quarter 1987, anincrease of 124 pct over the 28,000 contracts recorded in thesame months of 1986.    Institutions here had been slow to find out about the useof stock exchange futures, but they would now learn more,Jenkins predicted.    Commenting on the difference in popularity between giltsand bonds, Jenkins said Liffe had designed the widest possiblevariety of contracts so that at any given time, at least onesector would be volatile enough to attract trading. The currentsituation of U.S. Markets being steady, and U.K. Oneschangeable, might alter completely in coming months.    A further boost to Liffe's volume and attractiveness shouldcome with the introduction of yen bond futures, he added.

A bank statement said agriculture, set as the main growtharea in a five year economic recovery program adopted in 1985by African states, received 607 mln dlrs, 37 pct of the total.    The ADB is made up of the bank itself, its financingsoft loan arm, the African Development Fund (ADF) and theNigeria Trust Fund, another soft loan institution.    ADB president Babacar N'Diaye released a 1987 economicreport on Africa prepared by the ADB and the U.N. EconomicCommission for Africa (ECA), saying progress was being madetoward substantial increases in the bank's capital resources.    He said an ad hoc committee of the ADB board of governors,comprising 18 African and non African countries, recommended a200 pct increase in the organisation's capital for 1987 91.    He said such an increase would raise capital from around6.55 billion dlrs to 19.66 billion dlrs, adding he was hopefulthe proposal would be adopted at the annual meetings of thebank and fund, due to be held jointly in Cairo in June.    He welcomed France's recent proposals to the Paris Club ofWestern government creditors to extend repayment periods forThird World debts and give better rescheduling terms.    "The proposition represents a major step forward. ButAfrican countries should not be the ones to ask for large scaledebt write offs," he said. Africa's total external debt wasestimated at 175 billion dlrs at the end of 1986.    The ECA ADB report said prospects would remain bleak forAfrican economies in 1987 but predicted Gross Domestic Product(GDP) growth ranging between 2.5 and four pct, compared with1.2 pct last year.

Association chairman Arne Ogren told a news conference thata major restructuring of the sector was inevitable.    Central Bank governor Bengt Dennis said when announcing thederegulation in November 1985 that one of his main aims was togive commercial banks a chance to compete on equal terms withfinance companies and so undermine Sweden's "grey market."    Total credit granted by the Swedish finance companies roseto 77 billion crowns in 1986 from 64.7 billion in 1985. Thisincludes leasing and is the equivalent of 19 pct of alloutstanding loans by the banking sector at end 1986.    Ogren said that if proposals now being discussed by agovernment appointed inquiry into the credit market to licensefinance companies and make them increase their share capitalwere pushed through, up to 70 pct would disappear.    But he said this would in fact have little effect on creditvolumes as the 42 biggest finance companies accounted for 70pct of lending by the entire sector.    The explosive growth of Swedish finance companies began inthe early 1970s and commercial banks even started their own toget around the tight restrictions then imposed on bankingactivities and particularly on the growth of lending.    Now that they were on an equal footing with their parentcompanies, many bank owned finance companies faced an identitycrisis, Ogren said. He predicted there would be mergers andindividual firms would carve out specialised niches to ensuretheir survival in a deregulated climate.    Ogren said the sector's losses on bad loans were bound torise steeply in 1989 1990 due to the rush to increase credit.

While foreigners bought only four billion marks worth ofGerman bonds in February after 13 billion in January, they solda net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of publicauthorities after sales worth 300 mln in January.    With German investors' purchases of foreign securitiessteady around 1.3 billion marks, only 2.2 billion marks wereimported through securities transactions, after 11.2 billion.    Direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60billion marks in February after 2.83 billion in January.    There was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the short termcapital account after a surplus of 194 mln in January.    Banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds whiledomestic companies increased their short term financial assetsabroad by 700 mln. But public authorities received some onebillion marks from abroad, the Bundesbank said in a statement.    Combining long and short term capital outflows, WestGermany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks inFebruary against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in January.    The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widenedto 10.45 billion marks in February from January's 7.20 billion.    Taking the two months together the seasonally adjustedsurplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two. Interms of current as well as constant prices, the narrowing ofthe surplus was progressing, the bank said.    Germany's current account surplus widened to 6.63 billionmarks in February from 4.79 billion in January, but was down onthe 7.26 billion figure for February 1986. Seasonally adjusted,the February current account surplus narrowed against January.    While exports in February fell a half pct against the samemonth last year, imports fell 10 1/2 pct largely due to thedrop in prices. Exports grew three pct in volume and importstwo pct.    In the balance of services, a fall in net investment incomeled to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln marksurplus in January.    The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billionmarks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the EuropeanCommunity budget.

They said last week's cereals management committee agreedto release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tendersbetween April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned toallow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23.    However, it decided to leave consideration of the releaseof further wheat until later.    The British government had applied for the release of afurther 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from Britishintervention stores to prevent market prices rising.    However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to reviewthe market situation nearer the time before giving itsapproval.    The Commission was given new powers last year to controlthe release of intervention cereals onto the market, thesources noted.    Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministryof Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance thatadditional quantities of intervention wheat would be madeavailable in May and June. It also said that it was envisagedthat monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes,depending on the state of the market.    This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commissionhad actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during thethree months of April, May and June at last week's meeting.

General Motors gained two points to 83 1/2 and Ford one to91 1/8. Chrysler Corp C>, which is not expected to make anymajor announcements this week, rose 1/4 to 58 1/2.    "There is a little mystery coming at the end of the weekfor the automakers," one trader said, "and in a bull market,investors don't mind the mystery so much."    Yesterday, GM's stock climbed 1 3/4 points on expectationsthat the company might disclose some bullish news at a meetingbefore analysts on April 9 10. A GM spokesman had no comment onthe meeting.    GM chairman Roger Smith is expected to attend the meeting,along with GM president James McDonald and other senior GMexecutives.     "The stock could be moving up just on the proximity of themeeting, thinking GM will say something positive," analystPhilip Fricke of Goldman Sachs said.    Though he maintains a buy recommendation on GM, Fricke saidhe cut 1987 earnings estimates for the company by 50 cts ashare to 7.30 dlrs a share because of the costs of incentiveprograms. The company earned 8.21 dlrs a share in 1986.     Monday, Ford closed 2 5/8 points higher as rumorscirculated that the company would announce a higher dividendand a three for two stock split at it Thursday board meeting.

The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and apossible shortage of the key computer components in the nextfew weeks, the analysts said.    "Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay ofthe Japanese semiconductor industry," analyst Drew Peck ofDonaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said.    But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far,and some questioned whether Japan would be successful inforcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run.    Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence wasalready in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and haltedsales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sellchips at below production costs.    "We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D RAMS, andit has virtually dried up for EPROMS," said Merrill Lynchanalyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used incomputers.    "Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries arestretching," Kurlack added.    Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of InternationalTrade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs inproduction to meet the terms of last year's semiconductoraccord with the U.S.    The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs onJapanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed tolive up to the accord and continued to dump the computercomponents in the U.S. market.    But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the U.S.was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form oftrade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S.    As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, priceswill rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductormanufactures will be able to take up the slack since most longago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makersthat use the chips in their machines will then be pressured.    "The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce tradepressures from Washington, but at the same time they'redemonstating their muscle," analyst Peck said.    The cut backs in Japanese production are expected tobenefit U.S. chip makers.    "I think this could be a very important factor for U.S.semiconductor manufacturers," industry analyst Elliot Levine ofLadenburg Thalmann Co said.    But analyst Peck said, "it will take a few weeks to seewhether Japan has genuinely cut production."    He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI'srequest unfavorably because chip capacity was still high andproduction cut backs would lead to significant write offs inplant and equipment.

The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwaitwants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Sovietregistration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new"Silkworm" missiles at superpower flags.    The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open tointernational oil traffic and has warned Tehran against usingthe Chinese made missiles recently installed in Iran near themouth of the gulf.    "They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China andpossibly some other European countries to lease tankers tocarry their oil," one of the administration officials, who askednot to be identified, told Reuters.    The United States is considering the request to temporarilytransfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such amove could create insurance and other problems, the officialssaid.    U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwaithad decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S.offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in thegulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping.

Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on theuse of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986 88 couldresult in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs.    However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in netsavings for the government of 50 100 mln dlrs, he said.    Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly theentire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have beenforfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC.    In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have beenredeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges wouldhave remained in the goverment inventory, he said.    When asked to comment on a recent study by the GeneralAccounting Office that concluded certificates result in a netcost to the government, Amstutz said, "GAO underestimated thebenefits and overstated the costs" of the certificate program.    Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loanentries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions ratherthan forfeitures.    GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said.    "There is no question in the mind of the Department ofAgriculture that these certificates have been very useful,"Amstutz said.    Immediate benefits of certificates include greater marketliquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farmincome, and improved debt situation and decreased carryingcosts, he said.    Certificates are an integral part of USDA's long rangemarket oriented farm policy, he said.    Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dan Glickman,D Kans., that USDA is in the process of preparing an officialresponse to the GAO study on certificates and will submit it tothe subcommittee when completed.

Yesterday's sharp jump in the weekly corn export figure toabout three times last year's weekly inspections, plus theoutlook for a continued active export pace due to the declinein the U.S. dollar this year, supported nearbys, traders said.    Diminished PIK and roll activity, compared with the activepace seen last week, added to the more positive tone.    Most dealers expect the contract lows in corn futures tohold, with some looking for the improving chart picture tosupport a further advance.

The continuedimprovement would be due to good market demand, better productprices and high operating capacity, the company said in itsannual report.    Consolidated Bathurst, which reported operating profit of104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs, said itsjoint venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar,B.C. last year broadens its product range and will contributeto equity earnings.    Last year's results were up from 1985 operating profit of80 mln dlrs and sales of 1.73 billion dlrs.    The company said it views its near term prospects withimproved optimism.    It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in theU.K. should improve greatly this year due to stronger capacityand production and more favorable market conditions.    It said it anticipates a return to profitability in 1987for its Diamond Bathurst Inc (DBH) subsidiary, which lost 6.2mln U.S. dlrs and underwent a reorganization last year, andexpects higher sales and earnings for its other North Americanpackaging divisions.    Consolidated Bathurst said the outlook for its EuropaCarton unit is mixed. It said the effect of trade disputesbetween the United States and the European Economic Communityon the West German economy and the higher value of the mark maylead to increased costs which could not be offset by priceincreases.

The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiencypayments and paid land diversion payments in a two thirdcertificate, one third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989, Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told aHouse agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates.    Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughlya 50 50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said.    The Sparks study on certificates examined two possiblescenarios through the 1990 growing season   a "zerocertificate case," where no certificate program was assumed,and an alternative case labeled "adequate certificate case" inwhich sufficient certificates would be released so that grainprices would not be artificially supported by market shortagesdue to acreage reduction programs or government holdings.    The study showed that total grain use under the adequatecertificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenarioby 11.2 pct.    Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grainusage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed thezero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct.    For the five year period examined, government expendituresunder the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case.    The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct ofthose savings resulted from smaller government storage costs.    The study also estimated that government grain stocks underthe adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushelsbelow the zero certificate case at the end of the periodexamined.    The Sparks study said that while certificates permit marketprices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increasecommodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versuscash.

ABI chairman Giannino Parravicini told a news conferencethat the fund would not be operative until the latter part of1987, and only on condition that 60 pct of banks representingat least 75 pct of total deposits participated.    He said the fund would initially have 1,000 billion lireavailable and would cover deposits of up to three billion lire.    A statute for establishing a deposit guarantee fund hasalready been approved by the Bank of Italy and by aninterministerial committee on credit and savings.    The 1,000 billion lire initial funding, which will beprovided through contributions from banks which opt to join thescheme, compares with an originally targetted figure of 4,000billion lire.    Parravicini said the fund would be gradually increased to4,000 billion lire by end 1991, and that the decision toachieve this figure gradually rather than immediately was dueto fiscal considerations.    The fund, still to be formally ratified by ABI's steeringcommittee, will provide 100 pct coverage on deposits of up to200 mln lire, 90 pct on deposits between 200 mln and onebillion lire and 80 pct on those between one billion and threebillion lire.

The talks began in Washington yesterday and Tanjug said thegeneral attitude of the banks was "favourable."    At the same time, other Tanjug reports showed Yugoslavia ishaving difficulties in obtaining a 600 mln ECU loan from theEuropean Community (EC) and in receiving money owed to Yugoslavfirms by Middle Eastern countries.    The Western creditor governments and Kuwait agreed on March31 to refinance 475 mln dlrs of Yugoslavia's debt due in 1987and 1988. This made possible the talks with commercial banks.    Tanjug said sources close to the Yugoslav delegation saidthe initial reaction of commercial banks was favourable despitetheir continued insistence on "technical and legal elements."    It said it was believed that a commercial debt reschedulingwould be formally agreed in the next few weeks. Bank debtaccounts for about 70 pct of Yugoslavia's overall debt, whichstood at 19.7 billion dlrs at end 1986.    Tanjug said Yugoslavia also discussed with its commercialcreditors the idea of converting some of Yugoslavia's debt intojoint venture investments but it gave no details of this.    It said Deputy Finance Minister Boris Skapin was holdingtalks on this with representatives of Manufacturers HanoverTrust Co., Which coordinates the interests of several hundredbanks in Yugoslav debt negotiations.    In a separate report Tanjug said the EC has so far refuseda Yugoslav request for a 600 mln ECU infrastuctural loan and a100 mln ECU grant from the EC budget. The EC had so far onlyagreed to provide 380 mln ECUs towards transport modernisation.    It said Yugoslav Finance Minister Svetozar Rikanovicyesterday met World Bank and International Monetary Fundofficials in Washington.    It said the World Bank agreed that infrastructural projectsin Yugoslavia should be accelerated and structural adjustmentloans should be agreed this year.

"Everybody is waiting for developments from the talks. Inthe meantime, it's just jobbing positions back and forth," saida dealer at one U.S. bank.    The Group of Five, comprising the U.S., Japan, WestGermany, France and the U.K., are scheduled to convene today.    The dollar hovered at 145.25/30 yen, down from 145.85/90last night, and eased to 1.8255/60 marks from 1.8260/70.    The stage for the dollar's decline was set overnight in theFar East where the U.S. currency retreated despite steadyintervention on its behalf by the Bank of Japan.    Dealers in Japan cited speculation that the G 5/G 7 talksare unlikely to produce any significant or lasting measures tostabilize currencies as one reason for the sell off.    No central bank intervention was detected in the U.S. wherethe dollar kept well within recent trading parameters.    Despite the view that trade and economic imbalances dictatea downward course for the dollar, few U.S. dealers wished tosell it aggressively before this week's meetings.    Statements by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volckerduring testimony before the Senate Banking Committe failed torouse the market from its inertia.    Volcker reiterated that a further, sizeable dollar declinemay be counter productive. He also said that currency changesthat have occurred so far should be large enough   in acontext of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in theU.S.   to support expectations for a narrower U.S. trade gap.    "There was nothing new or remarkable there," said a dealerat one European bank. The dollar's brief rise to 1.8270 markswas already underway when Volcker spoke, he added.    With the dollar becalmed, dealers looked to cross rates,especially sterling, yen and Swiss franc, for interest.    Sterling continued to benefit from U.K. public opinionpolls indicating a lead for the ruling Conservative party inany general election and following signals of an improvedeconomy.    The pound hovered at 1.6175/85 dlrs, unchanged from Monday,and at 2.955 marks, off slightly from about 2.955 last night.    The dollar eased to 1.5120/30 Swiss francs from 1.5180/90,and to 1.3048/53 Canadian dollars from 1.3080/85 yesterday.

Prices were pressured early by firm sterling against thedollar as well as overhead West African new crop offers.    Opposing support was seen from prospective ICCO bufferstock buying (possibly next week) and recent Bahia Temperaocrop forecasts at down to 1.5 mln bags, dealers said.    The Ivory Coast was believed to have sold new cropyesterday around 1,325 French francs per 100 kilos cif whileGhana was also reported to be offering new crop at 1,460 stg atonne cif.    Such offers were still available although the fall fromearlier highs would have made them out of reach, dealers said.

The gain wasfueled by a strong auto sector as investors accumulated thestocks in anticipation of bullish news later this week.    The Dow Industrials, down 10 in the first minutes of thesession when a weak dollar and falling bond prices underscoredthe market's lingering interest rate anxieties, recovered tostand at 2417, up 11 points at midday. The broader marketshowed less vigor, however, as advances eked out a lead overdeclines. Volume was a strong 106 mln shares.   Ford, up over a point for most of the session, stood at90 5/8, up 1/2. Traders said that speculation that the companywill announce a stock split and dividend increase at its boardmeeting on Thursday, encouraged the buying. Ford rose 2 5/8yesterday.    General Motors rose 1 5/8 to 83 1/8 in anticipation ofbullish news coming out of an analysts meeting scheduled forThursday and Friday, traders said. Chrysler, not expected tomake any major announcements this week, fell 1/2 to 57 3/4.    "With the bonds weak this morning, the blue chips have beenholding the market up and that advance was sustained by aninflux of foreign money," analyst Charles Jensen of MKISecurities said. "But poor breadth and poor performance by thetransport and utility averages and the fact the market is atthe top of its trading band supported in large part by foreigncash, makes this market vulnerable," he said.    Traders noted that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker'sremarks today concerning the dollar's performance and itsbearing on monetary policy, injected caution into manyinvestors.

"There's too much disagreement between the Japanese and therest for them to come out with anything unanimous," said oneU.K. Merchant bank trader, reflecting the general tone.    However, dealers said position squaring helped push thedollar to a final 1.8240/50 marks, up from the opening1.8195/205 and near yesterday's close of 1.8245/55.    Meanwhile, the pound was underpinned by today's opinionpoll findings of further strong support for the ConservativeParty, but fear of Bank of England intervention limited buying.    Dealers said they doubted the U.K. Central bank had neededto sell sterling to curb rises today, with the markets soquiet. The Bank of England was rumoured to have sold poundsyesterday.    Sterling ended at 72.3 pct on the trade weighted index,unchanged from the opening but off 0.1 point from yesterday'sfinish. It closed at 1.6185/95 dlrs, after an opening 1.6213/23and previous close of 1.6163/73, and at 2.9490/520 marks,against an opening 2.9540/75 and yesterday's 2.9490/530.    Traders said there was little hope that the Westernfinanciers will be able to find a lasting solution to theproblem of currency instability during the current series oftalks in Washington.    These are scheduled to start today with an informal Groupof Five (G 5) session.    Tomorrow's Group of Seven meeting   of the U.S., Japan,West Germany, France, the U.K., Italy and Canada   is seen asthe key meeting.    Traders said few operators will be prepared to openpositions ahead of news emerging from the talks.    However, some traders said that, given the low level ofexpectations, the market could be particularly susceptible tosigns of accord between the U.S. And Japan, which would givethe dollar a sharp upward push.    They said interest is still largely centred on the yen,with any fresh dollar weakness expected to show in that marketfirst.    Meanwhile, today's comments from U.S. Federal Reserve BoardChairman Paul Volcker failed to have a lasting impact on themarket. His statement that a further sizeable dollar fall couldbe counter productive aided a brief run up in mid afternoon,but there was little followthrough, traders said.    The dollar finished at 145.25/35 yen, up from an opening145.05/15 but below yesterday's European close of 146.00/10.    It ended at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs, against the start of1.5130/40 and previous final 1.5180/90, and at 6.0650/700French francs, after beginning at 6.0525/75 and endingyesterday at 6.0660/710.

The inventors are Dr. Albert M. Kligman and Dr. GerdPlewig. Kligman, a University of Pennsylvania dermatologist,discovered the use of retinoic acid for treating acne.    Daltex said initial tests of the drug, a retinoid compound,have proved effective in treating "problem" skin most oftenfound in those over 50 and in those whose skin problems havebeen aggravated by excessive sun exposure.    In a Daltex statement, Dr Kligman said that daily doses ofthe drug can "moderate or reverse" a number of skin problemswithout the side effects typically associated with retinoidcompounds.    He said more than 100 men and women in the U.S. and Germanyhave been treated for six months to two years with the drug,and said studies indicate that its therapeutic effect can bemaintained if patients take maintenance doses two or threetimes a week.

Bills improved slightly on remarks from Federal Reservechairman Paul Volcker that a restrictive monetary policy wouldbe damaging to investment and that last week's increases inU.S. banks' prime lending rates to 7.75 pct from 7.50 pct wasnot connected with Fed policy, dealers said.     Coupon issues were 1/32 to 5/16 lower, pressured by a weakdollar. Treasury bill rates were anywhere from three basispoints lower to one basis point higher.    The key 7 1/2 pct Treasury bond was 5/16 lower at 95 26/32to yield 7.87 pct compared with 7.84 pct at yesterday's close.    Dealers said remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman PaulVolcker indicating that exchange rates had adjusted enough tonarrow the U.S. trade deficit and warning that a further,sizable dollar fall could be counterproductive had littleexchange rate impact as they were seen as a reiteration of hisviews.    In any case, they said the dollar is expected to be underpressure while monetary officials of leading industrial nationsmeet this week in Washington, which may hurt bonds.    Dealers said three month bill rates had eased early in thesession on a few sizable buy orders from retail accounts, butthat otherwise there was little activity in this sector.    "When Volcker hit the tape it helped bills, because itmakes people think the Fed is not going to tighten," a billtrader said. "But it's a nervous trade, with no real buyers."    Three month bills were bid at 5.50 pct, three basis pointsbelow their price at yesterday's auction, while six month billsrose one basis point from their auction price to 5.64 pct bid.    Year bills rose one basis points to 5.74 pct bid.    Most economists expected the Federal Reserve to supplytemporary reserves, but most had forecasted an indirectinjection via customer repurchase agreements rather than adirect injection via two day system repurchases which the Fedconducted at its usual intervention time.    The Fed intervened when Federal funds were trading at 6 1/8pct. Funds opened at this level and remained there at midday,down from yesterday's 6.20 pct avearge.    The 6 3/8 pct two year notes fell 1/32 to 99 21/32 atmidday and the 7 1/4 pct 10 years dropped 9/32 to 97 27/32.

At a meeting of the Northeast Midwest Coalition, anorganization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of theOntario Parliament's Select Committee on Economic Affairs, saidthe exemption would help trade relations.    The trade legislation to be considered by the full House inlate April would require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions wouldharm the U.S. economy.    Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on anygrounds.    Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S.congressmen, "I can understand (the trade bill). I think it hasto do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world."    "I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. Youdo not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerelyconsider exempting our country from that bill," he added.

USDA is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, thatwould offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in thecultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishablecommodities.    The department is considering including in its definitionof perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops,Spanish reeds and Christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane,the New York Times reported yesterday.    Rep. Howard Berman, D Calif., would like to see thedefinition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of whichis "a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,"Gene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said.    Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbyingUSDA hard to have their products covered by the amnestyprovision, farm industry sources said.    Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation saidlivestock producers were "desperate" because they fear they willbe unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joinedthat industry.    A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congressdid not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workerswho helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops andSpanish reeds was "marginal."    In addition, lawmakers made it clear during considerationof the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by thethe amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas trees"a tough call," this source said.    USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulationexcept to say it was subject to change before it will bereleased, probably some time later this month.    While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule underconsideration relating to perishable commodities, Congress isnot likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigrationquestion, congressional sources said.    The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workerswas crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill.    Congressional staff members estimate the special farmworker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to350,000 aliens. The law would allow eligible farm workers whoworked for 90 days during the year ending May 1, 1986, to applyfor temporary, then permanent, resident status.

In a speech Sunday, published in today's official paperGRANMA, Castro said unseasonable rains since January seriouslyinterrupted harvesting and milling operations especially in thecentral and western parts of the island.    The Cuban leader said the mechanical cane harvestersscheduled to cut over 60 pct of the cane this year wereparticularly "vulnerable," as muddy fields prevent operations.    Neither Castro nor the Cuban press have given out figuresto estimate tonnes of crude production during the presentharvest or the goals for the sugar campaign.    However, a cuban sugar official told Reuters that thecountry will be lucky if crude output reaches last year's 7.2mln tonnes. Output of crude for the previous 1984 85 harvestwas 8.2 mln tonnes.    The harvest was scheduled to end April 30 but due to thepresent shortfalls it will be extended into May and June, theofficial said.

ATT said it will file new prices at the PSC in August tomeet a Sept. 1 effective date set by the commission.    The telephone company said it asked the PSC on Nov. 7 forpermission to increase its prices for intrastate private lineservices, used mainly by large business customers, which ATTsaid were priced below its access costs.    "Private line service has been grossly underpriced since1984, and, therefore, it has been subsidized by all longdistance users," Terry Hobbs, assistant vice president said.

Slow country movement, yesterday's sharp jump in the weeklycorn export figure to about three times last year's weeklyinspections, plus the outlook for a continued active exportpace due to the decline in the U.S. dollar this year, supportednearbys, traders said.    Many traders said they were mystified why Drexel Burnhamwas such an aggressive buyer today in new crop December.    Farmers will probably plant as many acres as allowed underthe government programs and near record yields must be assumedat this time because they will aggressively apply fertilizer toprime yielding acres, one commercial trader noted.

He said themeasure was not linked to peru's foreign debt position. Chaseis one of peru's top private banking creditors.    Peru is over 700 mln dlrs in arrears on its interest owedto its 280 or so private foreign bank creditors, bankers said.    Sosa said chase opened its local consumer banking operationin september 1984. It held the equivalent of around four mlndlrs in deposits and had extended the equivalent ofabout five mln dlr in loans.    The bank still had to decide whether it would sell theholdings to another banking institution before closing theoperation, he said.

In remarks prepared for an address to members of theUniversity of Chicago's Graduate School of Business, Yeuttersaid many Congressional proposals do not appear to be overtlyprotectionist, yet their undeniable effect would be to closeoff market opportunitites, just as exchange rate movement isunleashing such opportunities for the first time in severalyears.    "Despite all our progress on trade policy and despite thePresident's comprehensive competitiveness initiative, there aremany in Congress who still are supporting trade billscontaining many dangerous provisions," Yuetter said.    Yeutter said many countries would prefer U.S. retaliationto opening their own markets. "We should be intelligent enoughto not let them off the hook that easily," he said.    He said that tough but flexible legislative language isinfinitely preferable to tough but inflexible language.    Both House and Senate trade proposals place undesirablelimits on Presidential discretion, he said.    "Limiting the President's ability to consider all availableoptions on issues as sensitive as these would be most unwise,"Yeutter said. "That could readily provoke retaliation, whichwould unneccesarily embroil us in trade wars, injuring mostcompetitive export industries."    Yeutter said present U.S. trade laws are fundamentallysound.    President Reagan has threatened or implemented retaliationeight times in the last 18 months   most recently in the caseof Japanese semiconductors being dumped in world markets.    "He took these steps as a last resort, only after carefullyanalyzing all the contingencies on a case by case basis andonly after determining that such actions would open markets toAmerican exports", he said.    Yeutter said it would be foolish to attempt to solve theU.S. trade deficit by focusing on trade policy alone. He addedthat the trade deficit was created primarily by macroeconomicpolicy shortcomings here and abroad.

The principal negotiator on the commission, created byPresident Jose Sarney, will be former foreign minister RamiroSaraiva Guerreiro.    Officials said Guerreiro would be joined on the commissionby eight senior officials, including a representative of theNational Security Council.    The creation of the commission is intended to underscorethe Brazilian government's contention that the debt issue isessentially political and that a political solution must befound to the problem.    On February 20 Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68billion dollar foreign bank debt to try to force the issue.    Creditor banks, however, have signalled that they areequally determined to resist Brazil's demands for debt relief.    Yesterday Funaro travelled to the United States for freshdebt negotiations with creditors deeply angered by Brasilia'ssuspension of interest payments.    Funaro was due to hold talks in New York today with theprivate sector, before travelling to Washington for the semi annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the WorldBank.    Officials said the new commission would start work inearnest when Funaro returns from the United States.    Yesterday Funaro called for a new forum for discussion ofthe foreign debt. He suggested direct participation of thegovernments of creditor countries in debt talks.    In negotiations on commercial debt, talks havetraditionally been restricted to banks.    The creation of the new commission brings Brazil's highlyprofessional Foreign Ministry much more into the forefront onthe debt issue than it has been in the past.    During the period of military rule, which ended in 1985,the Foreign Ministry played a very minor role in debt policy.    But the new commission has diplomats among its members andthe chief negotiator, Saraiva Guerreiro, is a seasoned envoywith a long diplomatic career.

The third High Command communique issued during the daysaid the Iranians launched a major overnight assault on thefronts of three Iraqi divisions, the Qutaiba, Muthanna andMohammed al Qassem forces.    The communique said the Iranian troops which attacked theQutaiba front were annihilated but the invading force managedto gain some footholds on the other fronts.    "Fierce fighting has been raging since dawn today and allmorning where our forces succeeded in dislodging the Iraniansfrom all the positions they gained at the Muthanna front andthe situation ended in Iraq's favour," the communique said.

"They made the filing in the First Court of Appeals inTexas," said John Jeffers, an attorney at the Houston law firmof Baker and Botts representing Pennzoil.    A Spokesman for Texaco had no immediate comment. Attorneysrepresenting Texaco were not immediately available.    The filing follows yesterday's decision by the U.S. SupremeCourt, overturning a lower federal court decision that had cutTexaco's bond to one billion dlrs. The high court ruled thatthe issue should first be considered by Texas state courts.    Texaco yesterday said it would soon file to preventenforcement of the bond, but it was unsure whether it wouldmake the filing in a District Court, the Court of Appeals orthe Texas Supreme Court.    Jeffers said Texaco chose the Appeals Court because itcurrently has jurisdiction in the case.    According to Texas state law, Texaco could be forced topost the full amount of the judgement as a bond. If it failedto do so, Pennzoil could seek liens on Texaco's assets for theamount of the judgement.    Texaco's filing contains a request to cut the amount of thebond to between one and 1.5 billion dlrs, Jeffers said. Askedwhat Pennzoil's thought of that amount, he said, "I don't thinkit's enough."    Pennzoil has repeatedly said it would not seek to forceTexaco to post the full amount of the judgement in the form ofa bond, but has said it would seek other forms of security.    "We've recognized there are other alternatives to a bond,"Jeffers, the Pennzoil attorney, said.    Pennzoil will also have the right to respond to the filingbut Jeffers said he was unsure when the response would be made.    The dispute between Texaco and Pennzoil stems from the 1984takeover of Getty Oil Co by Texaco. Pennzoil said the mergerviolated a prior agreement it had to buy Getty and sued Texaco.Since then, Pennzoil's position has twice been upheld by TexasState Courts. The Judgement now stands at 10.3 billion dlrs,including interest, and is on appeal.

As Brazil enters debt talks with creditors in the UnitedStates this week, political analysts say Sarney'sadministration has never appeared weaker.    The full political price which Sarney will have to pay forthe failure of the much vaunted anti inflation Cruzado Plan isstill not clear. He might have to pay with the presidency.    Calls are increasing for direct presidential elections topick a successor to Sarney early next year. The length of histerm will be decided by a Constituent Assembly, and Sarney hasbeen lobbying for a six year term.    Sarney came to power, without facing presidentialelections, in March 1985, when the military bowed out after 21years of rule.    Although there was wide public support for direct elections for president, the military as one of their lastacts, insisted an electoral college, where it felt it had moreinfluence, make the choice.    The college chose Tancredo Neves, a popular politician whoheaded the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), whichhad opposed military rule.    In part to smooth relations with the military, Neves choseSarney, a supporter of the generals, for the purely ceremonialpost of vice president. But Neves died before he could takeoffice and Sarney took power.    He won the grudging support of the PMDB and the CruzadoPlan was wildly popular with inflation weary Brazilians.    But the Cruzado Plan failed and politics in Brazil has notbeen the same.    "The country is a rudderless ship," said a U.S. Diplomat,echoing a common view that the government lacks any clear ideaof how to tackle the economic crisis.    Sarney has appeared increasingly isolated, with criticismcoming from the business community, the trade unions, some ofthe military, the media and political opponents.    Many businessmen are unhappy with Sarney's decisionannounced on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68billion dlrs of foreign debt.    A motor industry executive said: "The business communitythinks Brazil should go to the IMF. Their rules are sometimesharsh and strict, but this is the only way to put the house inorder."    Trade unions generally support the debt moratorium, butdisagree with other aspects of government policy. Since the endof February they have organized national strikes of seamen,bankworkers and federal university teachers and countless localstoppages and protests.    Economic problems have prompted criticism from somemilitary figures, including the last army ruler, General JoaoFigueiredo. It is a sign of the times that almost dailymilitary men deny there is going to be a coup.    If the army does stay in the barracks, the key arbitors ofSarney's fate will be the PMDB's leaders. So far, they have nottaken a clear stand on the issue of direct elections.    But one PMDB leader, Senator Affonso Camargo, pointedlysaid yesterday that it was the sovereign right of theConsituent Assembly to call direct elections for the presidencywhenever it wished.    In the media, Sarney has to contend with strong criticism.    One senior political commentator, Fernando Pedreira of theJornal do Brasil, wrote in the newspaper last week:    "President Sarney is ... a man of good intentions, but itis just possible that he himself is not aware of the true stateof the country and the people since the immense failure of theCruzado Plan.    "The disappointment, the frustration, the irritation, theenticement have been (and continue to be) too great, tooprofound."He called for direct elections early in 1988 as theonly way out of the present crisis.    One of Sao Paulo's leading news magazines, Senhor, said inan editorial this week: "The anarcho populist government ofPresident Jose Sarney has failed. Two years have already beentoo long for such a disastrous experience.    "It deserves to be buried as quickly as possible. Thenatural solution: direct elections soon."    The government's inability to control inflation is nowbringing with it serious social problems.    An explosion in rents in Sao Paulo has thrown tens ofthousands of families onto the streets because they can nolonger afford to pay even for a wooden shack in the slums.    The local press says the city is experiencing the biggestwave of land invasions in its history.   According to rental agencies, rents have increased 500 pctin little more than a year. Even the cheapest shacks now cost2,000 cruzados (90 dollars) a month, half as much again as theminimum wage, which is all that many earn.    Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, the Roman Catholic archbishopof Sao Paulo, warned yesterday of the possibility of "a socialconflict of unimaginable proportions."    With his back to the wall politically and with socialtensions rising, Sarney is no position to compromise on debt.

The principal negotiator on the commission, created byPresident Jose Sarney, will be former foreign minister RamiroSaraiva Guerreiro.    Officials said Guerreiro would be joined on the commissionby eight senior officials, including a representative of theNational Security Council.    The creation of the commission is intended to underscorethe Brazilian government's contention that the debt issue isessentially political and that a political solution must befound to the problem.    On February 20 Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68billion dlr foreign bank debt to try to force the issue.    Creditor banks, however, have signalled that they areequally determined to resist Brazil's demands for debt relief.    Yesterday Funaro travelled to the U.S. for fresh debtnegotiations with creditors deeply angered by Brasilia'ssuspension of interest payments.

"The dollar was trendless today. People are waiting to seeif anything new comes from the meetings tomorrow and will thentake it from there," said one dealer at a top European bank.    As a result, generally supportive comments by FederalReserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance MinisterKiichi Miyazawa went largely unheeded.    The dollar closed at 145.60/70 yen, down from 145.85/90.    However, the dollar's yen closing level was comfortablyabove its overseas low of just under 145 yen. Against the mark,the dollar finished at 1.8270/80 marks after falling to 1.8180in Europe and ending at 1.8260/70 here yesterday.    In Congressional testimony this morning, Fed Chairman PaulVolcker harped on his long held fears about the potentiallycatastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline.    He also said the dollar's fall, thus far, should be "largeenough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscalrestraint in the U.S., to support widespread expectations of anarrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead."    The market impact of Volcker's comments was minimal. "Itwas the same old story. Volcker was just fulfilling his role asa defender of the currency," said one trader.    The market was similarly dismissive of Japanese FinanceMinister Kiichi Miyazawa's upbeat appraisal of his hour longconversation with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker thisafternoon.    Miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need forcurrency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the rolethe U.S. has played in coordinated international efforts toprop up the dollar since the late February Paris agreement.    "Miyazawa can talk until he's blue in the face. The onlyperson who will make a difference is Baker," said Alan Rose ofFirst Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.    "The key question for the currency market is whether the(Reagan) administration will have a change of view on thedollar. If not, the dollar is going lower," he added.    The dollar's recent tumble to a 40 year low of 144.70 yenwas linked to the market's perception that Washington wasunhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalancesand that a continued orderly dollar decline was the leastdisruptive way of accelerating the process.    While most analysts do not expect any marked change ofattitude in Washington, they were reluctant to open any freshpositions until later in the week.    "We are reserving judgement for the time being," said DougMadison of Commerzbank Ag.    The tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterlingtrading today. The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at1.6175/85 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday.    However, underyling sentiment remains positive after a U.K.opinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highestpopularity rating since it was re elected in 1983.

He told a conference, held by the University of Chicago'sGraduate Business School, that much of this was caused bygovernments "getting their finger in the pot."    Yeutter referred specifically to the problems ofagricultural trade, where subsidized exports have been a pointof contention most notably between the United States and theEuropean Community.    "Think of the vast waste of financial and other resources,"he said.    Yeutter said much of the problem underlying the disputewith Japan over semiconductors was due to overproduction.    The trade representative called for a long term approach tointernational trade and said the recent commitment to afree trade agreement between the United States and Canada was astep in the right direction.    There's a lot of work to be done in the next six months,but we have set October 1 as a target date for an agreement tobe reached, he added.

"Joint ventures are the principal instrument forallowing the resources of the industrialized countries to bechanneled to the developing world so as to lead future growthfor both," Reviglio said.

The 500,000 mt per year plant will be constructed at Josein eastern Venezuela, and fed by butane produced at PDVSA'seastern cryogenic complex. ENI owns 48 pct of the joint venturecompany, Super Octanos, C.A., while Pequiven has 49 pct, withthe remaining three pct to be sold to private investors.

"We're still pushing for a fully invested position (in U.S.stocks) but we also recognize the market is up 40 pct sinceSeptember," says Burton Siegel, investment strategist.    Rein van der Does, director of international research,admits to being cautious and somewhat confused about certaindevelopments in the Tokyo market, such as Nippon Telephoneshares trading at 250 times earnings.    The firm recently dropped its recommendation on Jaguar plcJAGRY> following a sharp runup in the shares. About the sametime, says analyst Khaled Abdel Majeed, Drexel issued a buyrecommendation on the West german automaker BMW.    He says a new plant and new models brighten the outlook for1987 and 1988. "The company trades in Germany on the parentcompany's earnings but on worldwide consolidated earnings, themultiple is seven or eight, half that of competitors."    By contrast Jaguar's share price to earnings multiple isabout 12 and Daimler Benz AG is around 14 or 15.    Drexel analyst Lucille Palermo recently upgradedrecommendations on some Canadian gold stocks. With no recessionin sight she sees improved physical demand plus new buyinginterest from the Middle East. Also, expectation of a higherinflation rate stimulates demand.    On the supply side she thinks "people are overlooking theproblems in South Africa."  Palermo says all of this will pushthe bullion price to 475 dlrs an ounce by the end of the year.    Her current buy recommendations are Agnico Eagle Mines LtdAEAGF>, American Barrick Resources Corp ABX>, and Echo BayMines Ltd ECO>.    Palermo also believes the overall Canadian stock market hasgreater potential this year than last. Although the Canadiandollar has moved up slightly it is below levels of severalyears ago. "Canadian exports of all types look relatively cheapto foreigners   resources, manufactured goods, bonds andstocks."    Other European stocks favored by Drexel include ClubMediterranee CMI>, Pernod Ricard, Royal Dutch Petroleum RD>,Unilever UN>, British Petroleum Co plc BP> and ImperialChemical Industries plc ICI>. Drexel cautions U.S. investorsthat foreign dividends may be subject to withholding tax.

Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on theNew York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matchinglife of contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel.    "Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but willnot remain there long if products are not strong," RobertMurphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said.    Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that theAmerican Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domesticinventories of petroleum products in a weekly report.    Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation inthe Iran Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a newoffensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshoreoil fields and an oil export depot.    Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold andsilver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York.    Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before theclose with support from the silver market, which wasapproaching two year highs, traders said.    Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board ofTrade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher.    Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, andthe soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, whichis limiting supplies.    In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projecteda substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     Monday'sreport that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn forexport last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lackof farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traderssaid.    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower.    Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because manyfarmers are turning their attention to spring planting ratherthan marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash saleshave been lighter than expected this week.    The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, butprices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months asspeculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.    Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strengthrelated to tight supplies.    Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gainspast three year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meatpackers to bid aggressively for available animals.    However, some traders sold contracts to take profits afterthe extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contractsoar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the startof the year.    New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazilwould not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.

Earlier today, a lawyer for Pennzoil told Reuters a filinghad been made in the Texas court of Appeals.    "The petition asks the court to determine a reasonablesecurity arrangement between Texaco and Pennzoil," Texaco saidin a statement.    Texaco also said it asked the court for a temporaryrestraining order against Pennzoil's enforcement of the 10.3billion dlr judgement until the petition is resolved.    According to Texas law, Texaco could be forced to post thefull amount of the judgement as a bond. If it fails to do so,Pennzoil could seek liens against Texaco's assets for the fullamount of the judgement.    Yesterday the U.S. Supreme Court stuck down a lower federalcourt ruling which had cut Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs.It said the issue should first be considered in Texas stateCourts.

The key 7 1/2 pct Treasury bonds of 2016 fell 1 3/32 pointsto close at 95 1/32 and a 7.94 pct yield that was up 10 basispoints from Monday and was 1987's highest closing yield.    "Investors threw in the towel today. The long bond seemsheaded for eight pct within the next few days," a trader said.That would correspond to a price of about 94 3/8.    Treasury bill rates increased two to eight basis points.Notes prices declined 1/8 to 3/4.    Bond traders said the main negative is recent instabilityof the dollar and growing feeling that even concerted centralbank support will not be able to prevent a further sharpdecline in the U.S. currency.    The dollar came under mild downward pressure early andfinished with modest net losses. The currency was largelyunaffected by generally supportive comments by Federal ReserveChairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa.    Miyazawa once again said he and Treasury Secretary JamesBaker agree on the need for stable foreign exchange rates.    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told Congress that the dollar'sfall thus far should be "large enough, in a context of agrowing world economy and fiscal restraint in the U.S., tosupport widespread expectations of a narrowing in the realtrade deficit in the period ahead."    Despite favorable comments by Volcker and Miyazawa, thereappears to be broad agreement among currency and bond marketparticipants that a huge Federal budget deficit and a wide,although narrowing, trade gap will further depress the dollar.That could mean Japanese and other foreign investors will buyfewer U.S. bonds or even start selling them.    There has been no evidence of large scale sales of U.S.bonds by the Japanese. Some dealers said that these investorsactually purchased a modest amount of U.S. debt today, but theyfocused on shorter maturities in the two year area rather thanon long bonds.    To the extent that overseas investors back away from theU.S. bond market, dealers said that higher yields will beneeded to lure others to take their place.    A late Federal funds rate rise contributed slightly to thebond market retreat. After averaging 6.20 pct yesterday, fundsopened at 6 1/8 pct and traded between 6 1/16 and 6 1/4 pct.    The Federal funds rate rise occurred despite the Fed'sunexpected direct supply of temporary reserves. The Fedarranged two day System repurchase agreements with fundstrading at 6 1/8 pct.    Treasury bill rates increased largely in response to thehigher funds rate. Rates on new three and six month bills rosetwo and seven basis points from Monday's auction averages toclose at 5.55/54 pct and 5.70/69 pct. Year bills at 5.81/80 pctwere up eight basis points from yesterday's close.    Among notes, the 6 3/8s of 1989 dropped 1/8 to 99 9/16,with the 7 1/4s of 1996 down 3/4 at 97 3/8.

"The dollar was trendless today. People are waiting to seeif anything new comes from the meetings tomorrow and will thentake it from there," said one dealer at a top European bank.    As a result, generally supportive comments by FederalReserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance MinisterKiichi Miyazawa went largely unheeded.    The dollar closed at 145.60/70 yen, down from 145.85/90.    However, the dollar's yen closing level was comfortablyabove its overseas low of just under 145 yen. Against the mark,the dollar finished at 1.8270/80 marks after falling to 1.8180in Europe and ending at 1.8260/70 here yesterday.    In Congressional testimony this morning, Fed Chairman PaulVolcker harped on his long held fears about the potentiallycatastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline.    He also said the dollar's fall, thus far, should be "largeenough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscalrestraint in the U.S., to support widespread expectations of anarrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead."    The market impact of Volcker's comments was minimal. "Itwas the same old story. Volcker was just fulfilling his role asa defender of the currency," said one trader.    The market was similarly dismissive of Japanese FinanceMinister Kiichi Miyazawa's upbeat appraisal of his hour longconversation with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker thisafternoon.    Miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need forcurrency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the rolethe U.S. has played in coordinated international efforts toprop up the dollar since the late February Paris agreement.    "Miyazawa can talk until he's blue in the face. The onlyperson who will make a difference is Baker," said Alan Rose ofFirst Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.    "The key question for the currency market is whether the(Reagan) administration will have a change of view to thedollar. If not, the dollar is going lower," he added.    The dollar's recent tumble to a 40 year low of 144.70 yenwas linked to the market's perception that Washington wasunhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalancesand that a continued orderly dollar decline was the leastdisruptive way of accelerating the process.    While most analysts do not expect any marked change ofattitude in Washington, they were reluctant to open any freshpositions until later in the week.    "We are reserving judgement for the time being," said DougMadison of Commerzbank Ag.    The tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterlingtrading today. The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at1.6175/85 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday.    However, underlying sentiment remains positive after a U.K.opinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highestpopularity rating since it was re elected in 1983.    "Sterling still seems to be on the firm side," said onedealer.    The Canadian currency also retained a generally strongertone, rising to 1.3055/60 to its U.S. counterpart from1.3080/85 yesterday.    According to figures provided by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co,the dollar's trade weighted value at midday was 5.7 pct belowaverage market rates in 1980 82, compared with 5.5 pctyesterday.

The key 7 1/2 pct Treasury bonds of 2016 fell 1 3/32 pointsto close at 95 1/32 and a 7.94 pct yield that was up 10 basispoints from Monday and was 1987's highest closing yield.    "Investors threw in the towel today. The long bond seemsheaded for eight pct within the next few days," a trader said.That would correspond to a price of about 94 3/8.    Treasury bill rates increased two to eight basis points.Notes prices declined 1/8 to 3/4.    Bond traders said the main negative is recent instabilityof the dollar and growing feeling that even concerted centralbank support will not prevent a further drop in the dollar.

At a meeting of the Northeast Midwest Coalition, anorganization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of theOntario Parliament's Select Committee on Economic Affairs, saidthe exemption would help trade relations.    The trade legislation to be considered by the full House inlate April would require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions wouldharm the U.S. economy.    Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on anygrounds.    Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S.congressmen, "I can understand (the trade bill). I think it hasto do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world."    "I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. Youdo not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerelyconsider exempting our country from that bill," he added.    Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, withtwo way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985, according tothe coalition. But the U.S. ran up a 23 billion dlr deficit inmanufactured goods that year compared to a 14 billion dlrsurplus in services trade with its neighbour.

Such a possibility was unthinkable a few years back whenthe state's enormous wealth from oil and gas revenues easilyallowed Texans the luxury of paying no personal or corporateincome tax.     However, last year's dramatic slump in oil prices not onlysent the Texas economy into a tailspin, but cut heavily intothe state's tax revenues.    Both Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's cuttheir credit ratings of the state to double A from the toptriple A in early March.    Moody's Vice President George W. Leung said it was thefirst time Texas' rating had been lowered since 1962, addingthe report noted that while "the Legislature is now consideringproposals to restore budget balance, medium term prospects forfull recovery are weak."    With only a slight improvement in the economy seen by StateComptroller Bob Bullock, the Texas Legislature must grapplewith a one billion dlr deficit by August 31 and another 4.8billion dlr deficit by the end of the next biennium. No otherstate in U.S. history has faced such a deficit.    "There is a strong independent streak in Texans and fiveyears ago I would never have dreamed the State Legislaturewould institute an income tax," said George Bland, AssistantProfessor of Political Science at North Texas State University,adding, "Now my contacts at the Legislature tell me it'scoming, it's inevitable, it's only a matter of time."     State taxes on oil and gas production traditionallysupplied as much as a third of the state's revenues.    However, that source has fallen to about 15 pct in recentyears, and with last year's price slump, the state's dependenceon sales taxes is approaching 50 pct.     Bland said he believes the Tax Reform Act will be a majorfactor in the state's decision because under it sales taxes areno longer deductible from federal income tax while state incometax is.    John Kennedy, senior research associate at the Austin basedTexas Research League said, "There is a great deal of popularsentiment against it, plus the first plank of GovernorClements' platform was no tax increases, let alone a new tax."    However, he said that since the oil price fall the statefaced a choice of either instituting an income tax orbroadening and possibly raising the sales tax.    Steve Pejovich, director of the Center for Free Enterpriseat Texas A and M University and an opponent of income taxes,said he favored reforming the present tax system to takeaccount of the changed structure of the economy.    "We should rely less on traditional sources, such as oiland agriculture and real estate and more on service industries,manufacturing and high tech," Pejovich said.    Tony Proffitt, an aide to State Comptroller Bob Bullocksaid, "Bullock is opposed to an income tax, but has warned theLegislature that if they get tired of looking at everythingelse, that's the only option."    Apart from Texas, states which have no individual incometax are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota,Washington and Wyoming     For the time being, Attorney General Jim Mattox has ruledthat the Legislature may carry over the current one billion dlrdeficit into the next biennium, even though the stateconsitution requires a balanced budget. But as State TreasurerAnn Richards said last Thursday, "Jim Mattox's decision todayturns the heat down on the pressure cooker, but we must notthink that the goose isn't still cooking."    Opponents to new or higher taxes argue in favor of spendingcuts. But the state is already under pressure from a FederalDistrict Court to clean up its overcrowded prison system   orface 24 mln dlrs a month in fines.    And U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett has accusedthe state, among others, of lax education reform. Earlier thisyear, both houses of the Legislature, citing financialrestraints as well as teacher morale, passed bills abandoningplans to require teachers to take competency tests.    Bland said he believes the state will set up a commissionnext year to "study alternative revenue sources," with anincome tax being instituted as early as January 1989.    "If the political leaders are educated about (the effectsof the Tax Reform Act), I think there will be a gradual drifttoward income tax," he said.

This means that Gynex Labs, 50 pct owned by Gynex and 50pct by Watson Laboratories, will not get remuneration under thedistribution agreement beyond the 650,000 dlrs received fromSearle in February and March 1986. This has been applied to thecosts of inventories.    Searle and Gynex Labs will both bear costs involved with aproduct recall. Gynex Labs' cost is estimated at 900,000 dlrs,to be shared equally by Gynex Inc and Watson, it said.    The companies ended the agreement when it was determinedthat Searle's product line sales and marketing commitment wouldnot allow it to commit the necessary resources for the relaunchof the Gynex line of oral contraceptives, Gynex said.    After launching the first two Gynex products in earlyFebruary, Searle voluntarily recalled them in March as apreventive measure because a limited number of packages mayhave contained out of order or missing tablets.    Gynex has made changes that should prevent a recurrence ofthe problem, and is ready to reinitiate production, it said.Talks are underway with other potential distributors.

The Reagan administration is engaged in an internal debateover the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), as the land andspace based anti missile system is called, and may decide laterthis month to reinterpret the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missiletreaty to justify an acceleration of SDI research to includedevelopment and space testing.    Johnston, of Louisiana, and fellow Democrat WilliamProxmire of Wisconsin, whose staff prepared the report, accusedthe administration of covertly seeking early  deployment as apolitical ploy to commit the United States to strategicdefenses even after Reagan leaves office in 1989.    "This report exposes the fact that without a presidentialdirective or congressional consent, the SDI program ... isbeing changed to pursue a near term deployment of strategicdefenses," Proxmire, chairman of the powerful SenateAppropriations Defense Subcommittee, said.    "In other words, they're covertly reorienting the SDIprogram without congressional approval."

Currency target zones, or reference ranges, will not bediscussed at the G 7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow,the Japanese officials said.    The meeting, which is being held in conjunction with thisweek's International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions, willreaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing the language used in the Paris accord, the officials said.

The Japanese officials also declined to detail whatMiyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater jointintervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or onindependent American intervention.    The officials said such a money market action to stabilizethe dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan, which issuffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency, but alsofor the benefit of the United States as well.    As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost itsdomestic demand to reduce its trade surplus, Japan will explaineconomic measures to the G 7, the officials said.    However, Miyazawa failed to outline the size of theJapanese economic package in his meeting with Baker todaybecause the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized bythe Diet, or parliament, despite the new fiscal year whichstarted April one, the officials said.    Japan's ruling liberal democratic party revealed its owneconomic package today calling for more than 5,000 billion yenin additional spending.

The proposals must be adopted by the full House and Senatebefore becoming law.    The committee approved 3.5 billion dlrs for SDI, a land and space based anti missile defense program commonly known as"Star Wars." The amount was 1.7 billion dlrs less than theadministration request of 5.2 billion dlrs.    The Reagan administration has requested a total of 312billion dlrs for defense in 1988, but congressional leadershave said that will be cut as part of a budget trimming effortto reduce the huge federal deficit.    In other action today, the committee approved 250 mln dlrsfor a rail system for inter continental ballistic missiles, butdid not specify which missile system. Supporters have saidmissiles on such a rail network would be less vulernable toattack than those in fixed underground silos.

"The IMF and the Bank may be less inclined to put togetherlarge packages like Mexico," Ruding told reporters in a briefingon this week's semi annual IMF and World Bank talks.    Ruding, who is also chairman of the IMF's policy makingInterim Committee, said he was reflecting a feeling within thetwo institutions.    Asked whether his comments reflected a feeling theinstitutions were being unduly pressured by the Reaganadministration, Ruding replied "we should not go in thedirection of politicisation of the two institutions."    Ruding said "no country large or small should push in thatdirection."  He said he expected commercial bank lending todebtors to come in for some criticism for the slow pace oflending recently. Ruding also said he did not expect any majorinitiatives to develop a larger commercial bank role in thedebt strategy or any new proposals for dealing with the debtcrisis itself.    In other remarks, Ruding said many countries supported aGeneral Capital Increase for the World Bank and he expectedBank president Barber Conable also to express his support.    The U.S. has said it is opposed to a GCI at present.    Ruding said the Interim Committee Communique would supportthe use of indicators to assist multilateral surveillance butwould stop short of supporting U.S. proposals for automaticconsultations if indicators were sharply out of line withpolicy objectives. Monetary sources say the U.S. has suggestedestablishing "norms" or automatic triggers for consultationsamong industrial states if policies deviate from plan.    Currently the plan also has the support of France, theNetherlands and Italy while Britain, Japan and West Germany areall opposed.

"If they (the finance ministers) give the market somethingreally new to look at   that is, some package that goes beyondthe Paris agreement   you could have a real boost in thedollar," said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills.    On the other hand, "anything neutral would tend to bebearish for the dollar," Mills said.    Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of theParis accord will not be enough to halt the decline in thedollar, nor will central bank intervention.    "A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currenciesand sell the dollar," said one trader for a large retail firmon the floor of the IMM.    "If there is no concrete resolution, they will be lookingto sell the dollar, possibly down to the 1.80 mark level," hesaid.    Technically, most currency futures are poised for anotherrise, said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane.    Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract highon Tuesday and closed at its best level ever, while Junesterling set a new contract high on Monday.    "Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and youdon't need much to get things rolling," Sloane said.    In particular, the June Canadian dollar, for which Sloanerecently put out a buy recommendation, has hovered in a rangebetween 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks, forming a triangleon the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside.    A close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal abreakout, Sloane said, and would likely mean the nearbyCanadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the0.7800 level. June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday.    Mills noted, however, that interest rate differentialsbetween Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narroweddramatically recently, with yields on 10 year Canadian bondsonly about 80 basis points above U.S. 10 year notes.    What has helped the Canadian currency, she noted, is anincreasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into theCanadian equity market, particularly from Japanese investors.    Other analysts, however, said currency futures may be nearthe top of their long term rally.    "Something will be done at the (G 5 and G 7) meeting tocalm people," said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics.    The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major Europeancurrencies will trade, Horner said.    But sterling futures may still make another run for newhighs, up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the June contract, on thepositive atmosphere that will prevail before British electionsand possibly another interest rate cut, Horner said. The JuneBritish pound closed at 1.6080 on Tuesday.    Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range ofthe yen are likely to come out of the G 5 and G 7 meetings.    The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollarbetween 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152yen, Horner said. In yen futures, the bottom of the dollar'srange would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the Junecontract. June yen closed at 0.006913 on Tuesday.    If such a range does emerge from the meetings, "we willhave one more rally in the yen," Horner said.

In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairshere, Poehl said "It would be an extremely risky policy to aimfor a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar tocorrect the trade deficit."    He said the United States could face a vicious circle ofdepreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took thatroute.    Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meetU.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and toleratingabove target money supply growth.    He said he would have been happy to have brought forwardfive billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 tothe beginning of this year, but he said the government facedpolitical constraints getting such measures through the upperhouse of the West German parliament.    But there were also limits to the impact West Germany couldaccept on exports from a rising mark, he said.    Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for aboutone third of its gross national product, so a substantialerosion of export markets could not be offset by increasingdemand at home.    "A further appreciation of the mark could even be anobstacle to further growth," he said.    Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supplygrowth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation andbecause external factors, including low oil prices andfavourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.    But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemmaover monetary policy.    The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not thereported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germanywas affected more than before by exchange rate developments.    "For the time being, we will have to focus our policy moreon the external side, and we can live with a more expansionarymoney supply. But we must be very careful," he said.    He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan'strade surpluses, which affected European countries as well asthe United States.    Poehl welcomed the so called Louvre accord of monetaryofficials of major industrialized countries, saying theimportance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchangerates had been underestimated.    All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about theright level, and that further changes would damage growth, hesaid.    "This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on thepart of our American colleagues," he said.    But he said there was still a danger that the correction ofthe dollar's value could overshoot.

The dollar is expected to move between 145.00 and 145.60yen today as operators avoid taking big positions, despite lowexpectations from any Washington talks, dealers said. Thedollar's upward potential looks limited as selling interestappears strong around 145.60 yen, they said.    The dollar opened at 145.33 yen against 145.60/70 in NewYork and 145.25 at the close here yesterday.    The dollar opened at 1.8245/50 marks against 1.8270/80 inNew York. Sterling was unchanged from New York's 1.6175/85 dlrfinish.    The market is generally sceptical about the outcome of anyG 5 or G 7 meeting in Washington and the dollar is likely tocome under selling pressure which could push it towards 140 yenif no significant measures to stabilise currencies emerge,dealers said.    They said Japan is expected to try to strengthen the Parisaccord on currency stability, but added they expectdisagreement between Japan and other nations.    Japanese officials travelling with Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa told Reuters the G 7 will meet today, but currencytarget zones or reference ranges will not be discussed.    The Bank of Japan bought a small amount of dollars shortlyafter the opening at around 145.30 yen, when a medium sizedtrading house started to sell the dollar, dealers said.

They said the selling pressure was light ahead of expectedmeetings of leading finance ministers in Washington this week.Participants tended to keep their positions small and Bank ofJapan intervention shortly after Tokyo's opening at around145.30 yen failed to have a strong impact on the market, theysaid.    The dollar opened at 1.8247/57 marks against New York's1.8270/80 close and the 1.8205/15 finish here yesterday.    The dollar opened at 145.40/50 yen but weakened to near145.30 when the Bank of Japan intervened. It finished at145.60/70 in New York and 145.15/20 here yesterday.    Dealers said the dollar appeared to be holding comfortablyabove the critical 145 yen level now as yesterday's attempt tobreak that level failed for lack of momentum. But the marketsgenerally are not expecting much from the Washington talkstoday, they added.    The dollar is expected to stay within a tight range todaywith considerable selling pressure at the 145.60 yen and 1.8270mark levels, dealers said.    Dealers said supportive remarks yesterday from FederalReserve chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance MinisterKiichi Miyazawa were ignored as players squared positions.    Volcker told a Congressional committee the dollar's fall sofar should be "large enough ... To support widespreadexpectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in theperiod ahead."    Miyazawa, after meeting Treasury Secretary James Baker,said they agreed on the need for currency stabilization andthat he was satisfied with the role the U.S. Has played insupporting the dollar since the February Paris accord.    Sterling opened at 1.6182/92 dlrs against New York's1.6175/85 close and the 1.6200/10 finish here yesterday.    Dealers said sterling sentiment remains positive as theruling Conservative party maintained its lead in opinion polls.But they said technical selling may depress it to 1.6150.    The Hong Kong dollar opened at 7.8005/25 against its U.S.Counterpart compared with yesterday's 7.8015/35 close.

The law, proposed by Prime Minister Branko Mikulic, goesinto effect on July 1 and aims to end a long standing practiceof supporting unprofitable companies. Under the law, wage cutswill be imposed on losing enterprises, while those failing torecover within a six month grace period will face liquidation.    The diplomats said Mikulic's attempt to create a marketeconomy is inevitable, but has still come as a shock to thoseaccustomed to government subsidies.    "It was a bitter pill which had to be swallowed, but if anoverdose is taken too abruptly, it may have adverse effects onthe system," a Western diplomat said.    He said if the law was applied too strictly it wouldprobably provoke a new wave of strikes and unrest.    Yugoslavia was swept by strikes last month following theintroduction of a wage freeze law, later amended to allow moreflexibility and some exemptions in what some political analystssaw as a retreat by Mikulic.    But with inflation moving towards 100 pct, trade unionleaders have asked how much more deprivation workers can take.    The union leaders said workers thoughout the country arealready receiving salaries below limits set under existing law,while others have received no wages at all this year becausetheir employers are unable to pay them.    Workers also complain much of their income is taken inlocal, state and federal taxes.    Many others are losing their motivation to work andconfidence in government as they feel their decision makingpowers are being eroded, trade union officials said.    Meanwhile, the official Tanjug news agency reported a paperand cellulose factory at Ivangrad in the Montenegro republicclosed yesterday and 2,000 of its workers were given "temporaryleave."    Tanjug said the plant had been running at a loss for the 24years it had been in operation, and its closure was the resultof "economic necessity" rather than bankruptcy.

"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of timebeyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion ofexports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.," said TomMurtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker JamesCapel and Co>.    In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.    "We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat againstJapan because it serves as a warning to us," said a seniorTaiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.    Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs lastyear, 95 pct of it with the U.S.    The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reservesto 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.    "We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers andcut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if wewant to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation," saidPaul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters Taiwan Safe Group>.    A senior official of South Korea's trade promotionassociation said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japanmight also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exportsare similar to those of Japan.    Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billiondlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.    In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said toughcurbs against Japan might allow hard hit producers ofsemiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to theU.S.    In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has beenselling below cost semiconductors, some electronicsmanufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said sucha short term commercial advantage would be outweighed byfurther U.S. Pressure to block imports.    "That is a very short term view," said Lawrence Mills,director general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.    "If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it willbe extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kongis the disadvantage of action restraining trade," he said.    The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.    The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of tradetalks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.    "This kind of deterioration in trade relations between twocountries which are major trading partners of ours is a veryserious matter," Button said.    He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significantU.S. Exports to that country.    Meanwhile U.S. Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve thetrade stand off continue.    Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlineda package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.    The measures proposed include a large supplementary budgetand record public works spending in the first half of thefinancial year.    They also call for stepped up spending as an emergencymeasure to stimulate the economy despite Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.    Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and MakotoKuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade andIndustry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in aneffort to end the dispute.

Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oilmay also be introduced. But he said the question was stillbeing considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and nodecision on when to go ahead had been made.

"Several factors make us move cautiously," Nainggolan said."We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make amistake and undermine confidence in the exchange."    Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffeeadded in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up tofive months forward.

The trade ministry and exchange board are considering theintroduction of futures trading later for rubber, but oneofficial said a feasibility study was needed first.

Osaka based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bankwith an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, inOctober.    But despite the link up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsutold Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain itsposition.    "We'll be back in position in first place within threeyears," Komatsu said in an interview.    He said that while the merger will initially reduceSumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expandSumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area whereit has been relatively weak.    But financial analysts are divided on whether and howquickly the gamble will pay off.    Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo inview of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the mergerwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branchnetwork from scratch.    The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It hasexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities businessand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned thewisdom of some of those moves.    "They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Nowit's largely out of their hands," said Kleinwort Benson Ltdfinancial analyst Simon Smithson.    Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move toenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in Americaninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being atleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchangepersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other.    "The tie up is widely looked on as a lame duck because theFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected," said one analyst.    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.    "U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,we can do various things. We only have to wait two or threeyears, not until the 21st century," Komatsu said.    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routesinto the securities business at home.    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan'sversion of the U.S. Glass Steagall Act, separates commercialfrom investment banking.    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsusaid he hopes further deregulation will create newopportunities.    "We need to find new business chances," Komatsu said. "In somecases these will be securities related, in some cases trustbank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want."    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on suchdomestic securities business as profitable government bonddealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities CoLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about enteringthe securities business here through its Swiss universal banksubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences tosecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,following a similar decision for subsidiaries of Europeanuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similardecision on a Gottardo subsidiary.    "We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowedin two or three years," he said.    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expandlending to individuals and small and medium businesses toreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added.    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot oftime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including themerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.

Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buyback securities pledged on May 6.    Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today asan earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectivelywithdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market withtoday's allocation.    A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that thewithdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of creditpolicy, but was to be seen in the context of plentifulliquidity in the banking system.    Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbankover the first six days of the month, well clear of the likelyApril minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.    The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banksthemselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.    Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too muchliquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt theeffectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its mainopen market instrument for steering market interest rates. Twofurther pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.    The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6and 3.8 pct, although short term fluctuations outside thatrange are possible, dealers said.

It reported anet loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986,compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.    The company said it had been able to cut its losses becauseits scaled down copper operations in the central island of Cebustarted in the second half of 1986.

A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides inOctober last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.    Atlas said the two sides were also discussing equityinfusion into Atlas and the creation of a development fund forfurther exploration and development of the company's goldproperties in the central province of Masbate.    Wilson Banks, general manager of Bond Corp InternationalLtd> in Hong Kong, told Reuters the Atlas statement on thenegotiations was "reasonably accurate."

They said a 900 mln dlr saving from cheaper imported oiland 19.7 pct export growth last year contributed to thecountry's first current account surplus in 20 years.    But the bright picture, together with a government programto help farmers cope with depressed commodity prices, coincideswith sluggish investment by a private sector still feeling thelingering effects of the 1984 86 recession.    Thai banks have had growing surplus funds and difficultiesfinding borrowers since the third quarter of 1986.    Kunthon Narkprom, head of the budget and planning divisionof Thai Farmers Bank Ltd, estimated excess liquidity in bankspeaked last month at 60 billion baht, three times what heconsidered normal. Bank of Thailand figures show total depositsin 1986 grew 12.7 pct to 627.7 billion baht, while lending roseonly 3.4 pct to 548.6 billion.    The lending/deposit ratio, which measures bank loans as apercentage of deposits, fell to 86.6 pct last month, the lowestsince the 1970s, after averaging 96.6 pct in 1985.    Thai banks have cut lending and deposit rates a record sixtimes since January 1986, during which time the average minimumloan rate fell to 11.5 pct from 15.5 and the gross one yearfixed deposit rate to 7.25 pct from 11.    Five banks announced last week they would cut their maximumlending rates to small borrowers by one percentage point to 14pct.    Kunthon of Thai Farmers estimated banks now have a combined80 billion baht unused overdraft line as many small andmedium size companies delay borrowing in anticipation of morecuts in interest rates.    The record liquidity has seriously hurt the profits ofbanks, which have been forced to invest idle funds in low yieldgovernment securities.    Kunthon said the banks hold four to 10 billion baht inshort term government bonds bought through the Bank ofThailand's bond repurchase facility, double the normal amount.    Thailand's 16 local commercial banks registered one oftheir worst years in 1986, with overall profits falling over 30pct after a 14 pct decline in 1985.    Kunthon said profits should increase 10 pct this year asthe banks adjust to the new interest rate structure.    Olarn Chaipravat, senior executive vice president of SiamCommercial Bank Ltd, told reporters last week the liquidityproblem stems partly from the fact most loan demands come frombusinesses seeking funds for small, labour intensive projects.    He said there are few large, capital intensive projects andmany borrowers go offshore to meet their requirements.    Somboon Chinsavananond, Thai Farmers' fund managementexecutive, said liquidity has been aggravated by the centralbank's policy of fixing a stable baht dollar exchange ratewhich permits Thai companies to import dollar denominated fundswith a minimal risk of currency exchange losses.    He said underlying bearishness towards the U.S. Dollar hasencouraged foreign borrowers who hope to pay less on loanprincipal when their loans mature.    Thai bankers said central bank governor Kamchorn Sathirakullast month rejected a request to increase a 10 pct withholdingtax on interest on foreign loans, a measure they said wouldreduce foreign borrowings. The governor replied the bankersshould extend more loans to rural areas instead.    Bankers said some Thai banks have offered credit worthyclients loans at near money market rates of seven to eight pctin a bid to compete with foreign funds.    A market analyst at Siam Commercial Bank said bank lendingat such rates amount to about 15 pct of all loans extended bythe industry.    A foreign banker, who requested anonymity, said the"segmented market approach" used by Thai banks for settingdifferent lending rates has caused dislocation of funds in thefinancial sector, eroded bank profits and prevented banks fromtaking a more logical move of further cutting interest rates.    He said the liquidity problem gives the Bank of Thailand aperfect opportunity to assert more control on the Thai moneymarket.    The Bank of Thailand is taking "a step in the rightdirection" by planning to float three billion baht in bonds tomop up part of the surplus, he said, but he added the bank hasbeen lax in using its bond repurchase window as a tool toabsorb or inject liquidity into the market.    William Wu, head of the Treasury Unit of Chase ManhattanBank N.A., Said the money market lacks the instruments toabsorb liquidity and avoid sharp interest rate fluctuations.    He said the liquidity has fuelled the stock market'sstrongest rally in seven years and Thailand should seize theopportunity to develop the corporate bond market.

Two companies are ready to market such cars soon, theysaid. Honda Motor Co Ltd will sell its Prelude with four wheelsteering from this Friday, and Mazda Motor Corp officials say amodel with the new steering will be out by mid year. Mazda aimsto ship the cars overseas before year end but the decision willdepend on initial consumer reaction.    Nissan Motor Co Ltd has offered a less sophisticatedfour wheel steering system on its Skyline since August 1985.Toyota Motor Corp has exhibited its developments in the fieldat a recent motor show and Mitsubishi Motors Corp said it willuse the system in the near future.    Though major U.S. And European automakers have alsoresearched and tested the four wheel system, they say they arewaiting to see consumer response to the Japanese cars and forfurther improvements in safety and costs.    Four wheel steering allows drivers to easily manoeuvre intoparking spaces and gives more control on sharp turns.     Mazda officials believe the new steering will improvesafety. "At extremes, four wheel steering gives a driver morecontrol," said one official. "On slippery surfaces or at highspeeds, the system reduces unnecessary movement of the vehicle."    While acknowledging the added vehicle stability, a Hondaengineer said: "This invention is not intended to improvesafety, but is aimed at allowing everyone to drive easily."    Mazda's electronic steering system tells the back wheels toturn in the opposite direction from the front wheels at slowspeeds but in the same direction at high speeds.    Honda's system, which is mechanical, is similar but thedirection of the rear wheels is determined by the angle of thefront wheels. With Nissan's system the rear wheels move onlyparallel to the front.    Automakers say professional drivers who have tested thefour wheel steering say it greatly improves handling.    An official with one U.S. Vehicle manufacturer saidfour wheel steering is a technical improvement, but it isuncertain whether it will translate into higher sales orprofits. "All automakers are interested in something new," hesaid. "If it becomes a predominant factor, everyone will want tofollow."    The official said four wheel steering is partly a gimmickto sell cars. "It's a benefit of a secondary nature comparedwith devices for fuel economy or emission control."    General Motors Corp has developed a four wheel steeringsystem, but is unlikely to market it within the next fiveyears, Y. Hojoh, engineer with the Japan branch of GeneralMotors Overseas Corp, said. GM must consider the costs to theconsumer, he added.    The industry sources said the additional cost of the systemin Japan would probably make little difference to the consumeras it would be added to already high priced models.

"Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named,said. "Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market," he said.    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers.    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.End users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 16 27, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four yearbeef accord next March 31.    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business.    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan'stop business group Keidanren has urged the government to removeresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotionalreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issueshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in theindustrial sector.    "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and theseissues should not be discussed on the same table," the officialsaid.

He told a press conference the government planned toincrease investment, speed up the opening of the local marketto foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to holdthe surplus "at a proper level."    But he said the government would not allow the won toappreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea hasbeen under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.    The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus withthe U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3billion dlrs in 1985.    Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospectswere bright for the South Korean economy, but the governmentwould try to hold the current account surplus to around fivebillion dlrs a year for the next five years.    "Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, fivebillion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth inexports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But nowthe surplus is growing faster than we expected," he said.    Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of thisyear, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.    Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to asurplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlrdeficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled thecountry to reduce its foreign debt last year for the firsttime.    South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrsin 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largestin Asia.    "This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of themajor constraints on our development... Last year was a majorturning point for the Korean economy," Kim said.    Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio offoreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, fromabout 50 pct in 1986.    "The government, however, does not want to acceleratereducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus," hesaid.    Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflationand lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,particularly the United States.    "We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, butwe are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at aproper level," Kim said.

The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese CanadaInc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe LineCompany Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.    The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materialsavailability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and theimportant capital and operating advantages gained by locatingon an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.    The partners would look into the feasibility of a plantproducing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancerthat can replace tetra ethyl lead.    Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United Stateswhere lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because ofhealth concerns, the statement added.    Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as theU.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination inCanada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,it said.    Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over fivebillion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has amajor investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.    The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go onstream in late 1989, the statement said.

IG Metall, Western Europe's largest union, is reviving itscampaign for a 35 hour working week and is demanding a five pctpay increase. Strikes for a 35 hour week in 1984 brought WestGermany's automobile industry virtually to a standstill.    The result of the 1984 campaign was a compromise reductionin working hours to 38.5 from 40.    The talks which broke down yesterday were in the key NorthWuerttemberg/North Baden area, which generally sets the trendfor the rest of the country.    IG Metall official Ernst Eisenmann, speaking last night,blamed the failure of the negotiations on the employers. Hesaid they had been uncompromising on the question of theshorter week.    Hans Peter Stihl, negotiating for the employers, said anyplan to reduce working hours gradually to 35 hours wasunacceptable.     The employers have not made an official offer on cuttingthe working week, but sources involved in the negotiations saythat they are working on the basis of a possible half hourreduction from next year and a pay increase of 2.7 pct in 1987and of 1.5 pct in 1988.    The Union will propose that the negotiations be officiallydeclared a failure and then a process of arbitration is likely.    IG Metall has said that cutting the working week willcreate jobs in West Germany where more than two mln people areunemployed. IG Metall itself has about 2.5 mln members.    IG Metall has already been staging a series of "warningstrikes" to press home demands for the 35 hour week.    Yesterday, 23,000 engineering workers struck at 90 plantsfor one to two hours, according to an IG Metall statement.    Among the strikers were 4,000 at a Daimler Benz AG DAIG.F>plant in Bremen, and 3,100 at Ford Motor Co's F> Ford Werke AGplant in Saarlouis.

The composite index hit a record 405.13 early last week,nearly 50 pct up from the New Year when it stood at 264.82, butplunged to a 383.48 close on April 3, the day after thegovernment intervened.    Under the measures, industrial firms with bank loans worth50 billion won or more must either offer new shares or issueconvertible bonds to repay the loans.    Securities houses will have to sell shares they are holdingif the volume exceeds 40 pct of their paid in capital. Theceiling for investment trust firms was fixed at 50 pct.    South Korean firms have traditionally preferred obtaininglow interest bank loans   the current rate is 10 pct   toissuing bonds at a higher rate or floating share issues withthe attendant dividend pressures and launch expenses.    The Seoul Stock Exchange, with 355 listed stocks, grewexplosively in the first three months of the year, building onan already impressive 68.9 pct gain in 1986.    Analysts now expect the market to pause temporarily andthen resume its upward movement, despite the indirectgovernment regulation.    They said the continuous growth of the nation's grossnational product (GNP) and trade surplus, improved exports andgood performances by industrial firms all fuelled the boom.    The trade surplus widened to 460 mln dlrs in March from 110mln in February, while government economists expect GNP to grownine pct this year.    Analysts said the deep slump in the real estate market alsoincreased liquidity in the stock market.    "Many investors are still confident the market will not loseits strength. It seems likely to pause for a while and thenrebound again," said Park Sin bom, a director of LuckySecurities Co.    "There are more positive factors than negative. The marketis still buoyed by ample liquidity thanks to the economy'sstrong performance."    The stock market began to recover during Saturday'shalf day session with the index closing at 397.24 in activetrading on Monday, but closed lower on Tuesday at 390.24 onturnover of 76 billion won.    "I would say the market is flat for the time being.... It isvery prone to profit taking after the sharp gains in the firstthree months and the various government measures," a foreignanalyst said.    "But the market will head up again after a rest because thefundamentals are expected to rise and investors will be asbullish as ever at the slightest sign of a market recovery."    He added that the newly launched 30 mln dlr Korea EuropeFund would have an impact on the South Korean stock market,despite its small volume compared with the 5.72 trillion won oflisted capital on the Seoul exchange.    Local dealers recommend blue chips and financial shares asthese stand to benefit most from continuing trade frictionbetween the United States and Japan and the rumouredrestructuring of local finance houses.    Dealers also cite the shares of domestically orientedfirms, which are less vulnerable to the effects of the gradualappreciation of the won.

"A big step forward has been taken," said Industrial Bank ofJapan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi.    The package, seen as a response to mounting overseaspressure to boost the sagging Japanese economy, calls for asupplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen later thisyear, plus increased imports.    Although the measures must still gain the approval of theFinance Ministry, economists said the government will find ittoo difficult to alter the measures significantly once theyhave gained domestic and overseas backing.    "At last, the LDP and the Ministry of Finance are turning acorner," said Sumitomo Bank Ltd's chief economist MasahikoKoido.    For the past five years the government has adhered to atight fiscal policy in its drive to stop issuing deficitfinancing bonds in 1990.    To meet that goal, spending departments are required tosubmit annual budgets for current expenditure 10 pct below theprevious year and investment five pct below.    Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the LDP's policy affairscouncil, said yesterday the government must stick to its 1990fiscal reform target, but should review the ceiling it placeson public works spending.    Even some Finance Ministry officials privately acknowledgethat policy changes might be needed, including easing thegovernment's iron grip on spending.    Economists said the government could meet its 1990 targetand also increase spending by using money it got from the saleof Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp shares and by takingadvantage of lower than expected interest rates on its debt.Officially, the Finance Ministry is adhering to its tightstance but some signs of change have appeared.    "We do not have any intention of abandoning our objective torestore fiscal balance," a Finance Ministry spokesman said.    He said so far the ministry had tried to achieve two goalssimultaneously. These were reforming the government's fiscalposition and stimulating domestic demand.    But the Finance Ministry spokesman added, "In looking at thecurrent situation of the economy and the relationship betweenJapan and the United States, we feel we have to place moreemphasis on stimulating demand."    Economists predict battles within the government over thecoming months as the Finance Ministry fights to ensure thecracks in its policy do not lead to a complete breakdown offiscal discipline.    "The Ministry is afraid that once there is a small hole inthe dike, it will lead to a flood," Industrial Bank's Taketomisaid.    But Taketomi said the ministry, provided it has a device inplace to check excess spending for political reasons, is likelyto give the go ahead to a shift in policy.    "This seems to mark the first step toward a more activefiscal policy in response to requests from the internationalcommunity," he said.    Sumitomo's Koido said if the government quickly implementsthe LDP's 5,000 billion yen package, economic growth in the1987/88 year ending next March 31 could be around three pct,His current forecast of 2.2 pct growth assumes a supplementarybudget of around 1,000 billion yen.

Kim, who is also economic planning minister, told a newsconference the country's banks and finance houses had notdeveloped to keep pace with their industrial counterparts.    He said two major factors had hampered the development ofthe financial sector   high inflation and heavy governmentintervention in bank decision making.    He said in the past the government had pressed banks togive soft loans to industry to boost economic growth.    Kim said the government would now give top priority tointerest rate liberalisation. This could be achieved withinseveral years, though not within one year.    He said liberalisation was possible because South Korea'scurrent account had turned from a deficit to a surplus, whichhad brought in foreign funds and increased domestic savings.    The current account recorded a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrsin 1986 after a deficit of 890 mln dlrs in 1985.    But Kim said the government needed to reorganise much ofthe financial sector.    Kim said mergers of some financial companies and theupgrading of others to merchant banks or full banks were beingconsidered by the financial development committee of thefinance ministry. He did not elaborate but said he expected nodrastic measures to be announced this year.    On liberalisation of the country's stock market, Kim saiddespite Seoul's determination to open it up, free investmentsthere by foreigners would not be allowed in the near futurebecause the market was currently "over heated." He said this wasdue to ample liquidity created partly by the country's currentaccount surplus.    Kim said the market was extremely vulnerable to a suddeninflux of foreign funds because it was still very small interms of size and numbers of shareholders.    "Opening up the capital market must wait until thevulnerability to such an influx is removed," he said.    He said only about one mln South Koreans, out of apopulation of 40 mln, invest in the Seoul market.

High short term interest rates, a bullish stock market andan increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow offresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese andU.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.    Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash inand have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as theydiversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.    A one percentage point fall in key 10 year bonds rates inthe past month, record share prices and a 10 month high for thecurrency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.    Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capitalare not available, but brokers said they received almost dailyinquiries from Japan and the United States.    "These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing aboutand they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is endingup here with the attraction of high interest rates andreasonable currency stability," National Australia Bank Ltdeconomist Brian Hamley said.    "There is a 'flight to quality'," Hamley said. "Australia maynot be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't toomany other countries where you'd want to put your money."    The stronger Australian dollar was also attractinginvestors taking advantage of an appreciating currency againstthe volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.    "We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.Where some people would be concerned about the value of theU.S. Dollar," Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrosesaid. "Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheapand the currency looks stable?"    But turning that capital into more permanent productiveinvestment depends on government economic policy, he said.    "It will only disappear if people lose confidence in thedirection in the economy," Buttrose said, adding that offshoreinvestors would carefully watch the government's promised tougheconomic statement on May 14.    While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yieldinginterest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just aseasily reverse the flow   particularly the Japanese, who werebadly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollarand hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.    "It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to bedelivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, onemight see a substantial outflow," Buttrose said.    Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tougheconomic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt andstubborn current account deficit, analysts said.    "They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I thinkthey would like to leave the money here," Buttrose said.    Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increasedinterest in investment in Australia and the need to shieldJapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.    Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged anelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currencypolicy when he said authorities could not take their "eyes offthe yen" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.    Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had workedsuccessfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollarwithin the range of 100 to 103 yen.    Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, theAustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on atrade weighted basis in the last three weeks.    Offshore buying has also played a role in the boomingAustralian share market. It has followed Wall Street and othermarkets, but is also setting its own trend in response to theweight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring intoequities, particularly in the gold sector.    The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, whilethe gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in thesame period.    The property sector is also sought after, with Japanesecompanies that have invested heavily in the United States inrecent years turning their attention to undervalued realestate, particularly in the tourism field.    Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five starRegent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrsas indicative of the type of property being sought.    "They think they find good value real estate here which,with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind ofinvestment Australia needs," Buttrose added.

Crucial will be the ability of the 13 member OPEC to holdoil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in thenorthern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.    Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of grossdomestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last yearafter contracting 8.1 pct the year before.    This was after taking into account inflation in consumerprices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.    Factors depressing economic activity include the6 1/2 year old Iran Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, whichthreatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through theGulf and has sapped business confidence.    But sentiment received a much needed boost in Septemberwhen, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisiscaused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensivenew debt settlement program was introduced.    The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forwardtrading, left 95 billion dlrs of post dated cheques in default.    The cheques were also used as collateral for consumerspending, thus generating an informal credit system.    Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums arestill owed by individuals and companies.    There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of whichone quarter to one third was estimated by bankers to rank asbad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said itwill not allow any banks to go under.    The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling ofproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whetherdebtors have regular cash flows or not.    Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rightsguaranteed by the government   an edict of vital significancein a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sectoris the biggest after oil.    Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to rideout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.    Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned lastyear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al Khalifa al Sabah.    But strategic diversification into downstream operations inEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment athome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sellover one half of its output as high grade refined oil products.    Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processedproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than ascrude.    Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reasonfor cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domesticinflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recentyears and signs government spending on productive sectors willremain steady.    External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct belowthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession hitGulf.    Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid 1986 were putofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment incomeof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.    But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, thesereserves may not be enough to prevent a "real" budget deficit forthe 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.    In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.    This left out income from state reserves, usually excludedin official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers atup to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in someshortfall.    Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast foreconomic growth this year or next.    "It depends on oil prices," one said. "This summer isimportant."    Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al Rashid said last Sundaythe cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise statespending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate theeconomy.    He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to bespelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.

Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliserand overstressed palms, they said.    The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil Worldnewsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely todrop sharply this year.    Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell morepalm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage theindustry, a leading grower told Reuters.    The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnesagainst about 800,000 last March, the growers said.    The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this yeardue to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.    The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.    In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expectedto enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oiloutput peaks.    They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new treesagainst 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reductionwill not be felt for about another three years.

Norwegian Bank Association President Trond Reinertsen toldReuters the new rule would make it more difficult for banks totransfer funds to financial and insurance companies forlending.    Banks have in the past used the two month lapse in loanregistration to transfer money for lending to finance andinsurance groups to avoid penalty reserve requirements forlending in excess of government set ceilings.    The new rule brings loan reporting requirements forinsurance and finance companies in line with those alreadyapplied to commercial banks, Ministry officials said.    Borrowers have increasingly sought loans from finance andinsurance companies after the central bank last year clampeddown on what it called excessive bank lending.    Bank lending dropped by five billion crowns in January from260 billion crowns the previous month in response to thestricter penalty reserve requirements, Oslo bankers said.

A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPBfrom selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC'soutstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings onApril 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a formerchairman of both SMC and UCPB.    Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.    Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB andrepresented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB'splans to sell the shares to SMC were "a serious breach offiduciary duties."    The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also beheld up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, agovernment nominee on the company's board.    De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week bythe company's board.    On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of thesequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos pershare. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retainedearnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by thepurchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration ofdividends.    De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violatean SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2 to 1 debtto equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramondel Rosario as telling the board that the transaction wouldboost the ratio to 2.5 to 1.    In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earliersuit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman AndresSoriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.    De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuminglast December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kongsubsidiary Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's boardmeeting.    An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino toresolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report byApril 15.    "The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part ofa continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregardof the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an earlydisposition of the sequestered shares," San Miguel Corp said ina statement.    "Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB havereached agreement on the price of the shares and the method ofpayment, this suit is in direct contravention of thegovernment's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlementof the controversy by April 15," the statement added.    A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment onCojuangco's court petition, adding: "Any statement coming fromus might be interpreted as adversarial."    Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel whichsequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligibleto buy the major portion of the shares because he was a UnitedStates citizen.    The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln "A" shares,which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln "B" shares whichare available to foreign buyers.    SMC sources said Soriano personally was not amongprospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased bythe A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamedinstitutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyersin a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.    The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission onGood Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they wereowned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former PresidentFerdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self imposed exile in theU.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividendannounced last June.    "We have no objection to Soriano buying the "B" shares," Diaztold Reuters. "But everything is on hold now."    The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversywould be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'meeting, scheduled for May 14.    San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billionpesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.

Although the Mackay Burdekin crop outlook is much betterthan it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesmansaid.

Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg regionand southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition andsome mills are forecasting record crops, he said.

In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairshere, Poehl said "It would be an extremely risky policy to aimfor a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar tocorrect the trade deficit."    He said the United States could face a vicious circle ofdepreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took thatroute.    Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meetU.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and toleratingabove target money supply growth.    He said he would have been happy to have brought forwardfive billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 tothe beginning of this year, but he said the government facedpolitical constraints getting such measures through the upperhouse of the West German parliament.    But there were also limits to the impact West Germany couldaccept on exports from a rising mark, he said.    Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for aboutone third of its gross national product, so a substantialerosion of export markets could not be offset by increasingdemand at home.    "A further appreciation of the mark could even be anobstacle to further growth," he said.    Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supplygrowth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation andbecause external factors, including low oil prices andfavourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.    But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemmaover monetary policy.    The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not thereported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germanywas affected more than before by exchange rate developments.    "For the time being, we will have to focus our policy moreon the external side, and we can live with a more expansionarymoney supply. But we must be very careful," he said.    He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan'strade surpluses, which affected European countries as well asthe United States.    Poehl welcomed the so called Louvre accord of monetaryofficials of major industrialized countries, saying theimportance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchangerates had been underestimated.    All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about theright level, and that further changes would damage growth, hesaid.    "This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on thepart of our American colleagues," he said.    But he said there was still a danger that the correction ofthe dollar's value could overshoot.

Japan should not see industrializing Asian nations as merecompetitors in its overseas and domestic markets but ascountries that can contribute to the region's prosperity.    The bank said trade relations between Japan and the Asianneighbouring countries have so far been vertical, meaning thatJapan imports primary goods from those countries and exportsmanufactured goods to them.

A spokeswoman for the California Board of Accountancy,which certifies public accountants and firms in the state, saida six page complaint was filed against the New York basedaccounting firm.    "We basically charged that the Technical Equities audit wasnot conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditingstandards," Della Bousquet, executive officer for the board,told Reuters in a telephone interview.    She said a hearing would probably be held before anadministrative law judge within three months. Penalties couldrange from censure to revocation of KMG Main Hurdman's licenseto do business in California.    KMG Main Hurdman merged last week with Peat MarwickMitchell of New York to become the world's largest accountingfirm.    The San Francisco office of the firm declined to comment onthe board's allegations.    Bousquet said the company, among other things, was accusedof not properly investigating financial transactions and ofissuing a favorable opinion in August 1985 that relied onmisrepresentations of Technical Equities management.    She said the accounting firm, although it knew TechnicalEquities had severe cash flow and liquidity problems, wasaccused of not performing a proper audit of it.    The complaint named four individuals, including twopartners and two audit managers.    Technical Equities, based in San Jose, filed for protectionunder Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws in February 1986,listing debts of 69.7 mln dlrs to 1,068 investors.

The annual report of the U.N. Economic and SocialCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) said theinternational economic environment reversed the fortunes of thetrade oriented economies of the six ASEAN member countries.    It said the already low 1985 growth rates of ASEAN's oilexporting countries   Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia  dropped further after the oil price fall.    Three oil importers   Singapore, the Philippines andThailand   improved their performance mainly by restructuringtheir economies. But the report said the oil price fall reducedexport earnings, worsening economic prospects for theexporters.    The exporters' non oil commodity prices did not show majorimprovement and protectionist pressures from industrialcountries restricted export of manufactured products, it said.    The GDPs of Indonesia, which was 1.9 pct in 1985, andMalaysia, which fell a real one pct, barely grew in 1986.    The two countries, buffeted by unfavourable externalfactors in the past few years, were forced to curb aggregatedomestic consumption demands last year to avoid severe balanceof payments pressures and to resort to extensive commercialborrowings.    The U.N. Body said the economic outlooks of Singapore,Thailand and the Philippines improved steadily in 1986 as theyear advanced. It said the most favourable factor benefitingthe three was the realignment of key currencies, especially theappreciation of the yen, which has resulted in the increasedcompetitiveness of their exports against those from Japan.    The report said the downward spiral plaguing the Philippineeconomy since 1983 was reversed into an estimated 0.9 pct GDPgrowth in 1986 with agriculture and public utilities becominggrowth sectors.    It said the resumption of the Philippines' sustained growthrests largely on a satisfactory solution of its debt problem.    ESCAP said the yen appreciation, together with economicrestructuring measures, played a big role in helping Singaporerecover faster than expected from its 1.8 pct GDP decline in1985.    It said the Singapore GDP achieved a growth of over one pctlast year after registering positive growth from the secondquarter.    The Singapore economic revival was hampered by its ownadjustment measures especially its two year wage freezeenforced last April, a glut of its property market anddepressed conditions in its ASEAN neighbours which hurtSingapore because they take about a quarter of its totalexports.    The report said Thailand benefited from the changing worldeconomic environment far more than any of its ASEAN neighbours.    The Thai performance stemmed from the expansion o itsnon traditional export items last year to cover moremanufactured products and its greater exploration ofunsaturated export markets such as Asia, the Middle East andthe European Community.

British consumer affairs minister Michael Howard toldreporters he was dissatisfied with the exchange's response toBritain's non negotiable timetable for increased Britishmembership and warned of possible reprisals in the future.    He described his meeting with Tokyo stock exchange (TSE)head Michio Takeuchi, in which he demanded greater exchangeaccess, as "very frank indeed."    In a separate press conference, TSE President MichioTakeuchi said the exchange has done its utmost to liberaliseits membership and called on Britain to make some concessions.    According to Takeuchi, Howard wants three British firms tobe named members of the Tokyo stock exchange by the end of thisyear. Neither Takeuchi nor Howard would name the companies.    "Next May is the earliest possible date for opening ourmembership and I want the British government to understandthis," Takeuchi said.    Membership cannot be increased before space on the tradingfloor is expanded in May 1988, he said.     Howard told reporters that was not good enough and saidthat Britain would use its powers to ban Japanese financialinstitutions from London if it was not satisfied with Tokyo.    Japan has until the next meeting of senior officials fromthe two countries in May or June to come up with a postiveresponse to the British timetable or face retaliation, he said.    "The timetable was constructed in a way that made it a veryreasonable request and I expect it to be met," he said.    Asked about the exchange's argument that it has no floorspace to expand membership, Howard replied, "We find it verydifficult in our country to understand why the considerableingenuity and resourcefulness of the Japanese (in worldmarkets) is unable to overcome problems of that kind."    While here, Howard said he also expressed frustration withthe huge trade imbalance with Japan and with Tokyo's handlingof demands by Britain's Cable and Wireless for a greater rolein Japan's telecommunications business.    According to Japanese newspaper reports, at least some ofthat message may have penetrated.    According to several reports, the Post andTelecommunications Ministry is considering a Cable and Wirelessproposal for a telephone cable between Japan and the U.S.    Ministry officials were unavailable for comment.

But inspectors are paying particular attention to foreignexchange matters in their routine checks at banks, he said inanswer to enquiries. There is no evidence rules were broken.    The LZB spokesman was commenting on press reports thatbanks had "parked" open currency positions for short periods withVW to circumvent regulations limiting the size of open currencypositions that can be carried by banks overnight.    The press allegations emerged after VW said it may havelost 480 mln marks as a result of a possible currency fraud.    LZBs are regional branches of the Bundesbank. Theirinspectors also act for the Federal Banking Supervisory Officein West Berlin, which regulates banking in West Germany.    Following the 1974 Herstatt bank crash on currencyspeculation, West Germany limited a bank's total open positionsovernight to 30 pct of shareholders' equity and reserves.    German press reports have said some banks circumvented thisrule by selling excess positions to VW, then repurchasing them.    The banking regulations only cover banks. Company foreignexchange activities are not subject to the banking regulators.    The LZB spokesman said there were no concrete signs thatthe regulations had been broken, and it would be irresponsibleto instigate a special check just on the basis of the reports.    The LZBs receive monthly balance sheet statistics frombanks in their areas, which they check, and they also routinelyinspect all banks in greater detail over longer periods.    But LZB officials said it would be hard for inspectors todetect a breach of these rules as they do not check companiesand therefore would not see both sides of any parking deal.    "If the managements of the banks have not spotted them, itwill be even harder for our inspectors," said one official.    It would be up to the public prosecutors to order specialchecks on suspicion of breaches of these regulations, theysaid. Prosecutors in Brunswick are already investigating the VWcurrency scandal, and have ordered the arrest of VW's formerchief foreign exchange dealer.    Breaches of the Banking Law in this way can be punished bya 100,000 mark fine for the dealers involved, and in extremecases by removal of the managers if their active involvement isproved.

Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province ofFlevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up anagenda and procedures for meetings between the employers andunions on a work practice agreement and proposed redundancies.    Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 inprotest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the4,000 strong workforce this year.    The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV onMarch 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunctionagainst the redundancies on procedural grounds.    The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 butZeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against theemployers and they were therefore very likely to restart thecomplicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.    Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work practice agreementin the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenanceworkers on strike, although loading was not affected, aspokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in thesector, said.

Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increasedthe chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.    "We are proposing legislation that would provide for moredisclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and wouldinsure that takeovers are properly financed," he said.    Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the thresholdfor notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that ainvestor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in acompany to three pct from the current five pct threshold within10 days, Proxmire said.    In addition, there would be a pre notificaton requirementthat an investor intended to aquire three pct that would haveto filed with the SEC.    Proxmire said the pre notification requirement was meant toprevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public inknowing about coming takeover attempts.    Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that atender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60business days from the current 20 business days.    His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiringcompany violated the time period on the tender offer.    To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmiresaid the legislation would aim at insuring current marginrequirments are properly enforced.    The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirementfor purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generallyenforced in hostile takeovers.    Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeoverdeclare that they can raise the capital for a takeover withoutactually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.    He said his bill would allow private suits for damages forfailure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct marginrequirements.    The bill also would require more disclose when severalinvestors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.    "When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to knowabout it," Proxmire said.    Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britaintowards two tiered tender offers that insures that allshareholders recieve equal treatment.    He said he expected amendments to the bill also would coverdefensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.    Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later thismonth and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.    He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill thisyear.

Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrsof medium  and long term debt on February 22.    U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stopaccruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of "the highpotential of a continued suspension that would result inreaching the 90 day limit in the second quarter of 1987."    Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates arereceived for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated thatfull year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.    Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiationsbetween Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to theresumption of interest payments.    The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when centralbank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a90 day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt thatmatures on April 15.

Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weaknessof the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries andCanada to keep exchange rates near the then current levels.    But he declined to say what measures would be discussedahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers latertoday.    Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl saidthe importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvreaccord, had been underestimated.    Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among majorcountries than six months ago, at the time of the annualmeeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,marked by sharp discord between the United States and its majortrading partners.    "There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord," hesaid. "We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I donot want to discuss that here.    Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a"slight firming" of the yen against the dollar.    And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchangedsince February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sellmarks to support the dollar.    "The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market," hesaid.    Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of thebargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to beaccelerated as a way of stimulating growth.    Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled itspledges for economic stimulation.    "And we will have to see if the United States is able to dowhat they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit  and get it through Congress," he added.    Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a furtherfall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct againstthe dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade weighted basis.    "You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. Andit is not just a German problem, it is a European problem," hesaid.
